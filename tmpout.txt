Bacterial toxins represent a vast reservoir of biochemical diversity that can be 
repurposed for biomedical applications. Such proteins include a group of predicted 
interbacterial toxins of the deaminase superfamily, members of which have found 
application in gene-editing techniques1,2. Because previously described cytidine 
deaminases operate on single-stranded nucleic acids3, their use in base editing 
requires the unwinding of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA)—for example by a CRISPR–
Cas9 system. Base editing within mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), however, has thus far 
been hindered by challenges associated with the delivery of guide RNA into the 
mitochondria4. As a consequence, manipulation of mtDNA to date has been limited to 
the targeted destruction of the mitochondrial genome by designer nucleases9,10.Here 
we describe an interbacterial toxin, which we name DddA, that catalyses the 
deamination of cytidines within dsDNA. We engineered split-DddA halves that are 
non-toxic and inactive until brought together on target DNA by adjacently bound 
programmable DNA-binding proteins. Fusions of the split-DddA halves, transcription 
activator-like effector array proteins, and a uracil glycosylase inhibitor resulted in 
RNA-free DddA-derived cytosine base editors (DdCBEs) that catalyse C•G-to-T•A 
conversions in human mtDNA with high target specificity and product purity. We used 
DdCBEs to model a disease-associated mtDNA mutation in human cells, resulting in 
changes in respiration rates and oxidative phosphorylation. CRISPR-free DdCBEs 
enable the precise manipulation of mtDNA, rather than the elimination of mtDNA 
copies that results from its cleavage by targeted nucleases, with broad implications 
for the study and potential treatment of mitochondrial disorders.

Inherited or acquired mutations in mtDNA are associated with a range 
of human diseases5,6. Tools for introducing specific modifications into 
mtDNA are urgently needed both to model and to potentially treat 
these diseases. The development of such tools, however, has been 
hindered by the challenge of transporting RNAs into mitochondria, 
including guide RNAs that are required to program CRISPR-associated 
proteins4.
Each mammalian cell contains many copies of a circular mtDNA that 
can exist in a heteroplasmic mixture of wild-type and mutant alleles7. 
Current approaches to manipulate mtDNA rely on RNA-free program-
mable nucleases, such as transcription activator-like effector nucleases 
(TALENs)8,9 and zinc finger nucleases10, fused to mitochondrial target-
ing signal (MTS) sequences to induce double-strand breaks in mtDNA. 
Linearized mtDNA is rapidly degraded11,12, resulting in heteroplasmic 
shifts to favour uncut mtDNA genomes. As a candidate therapeutic 
or disease-modelling tool, this approach cannot introduce specific 

nucleotide changes in mtDNA, and cannot be applied to homoplasmic 
mtDNA mutations because destroying all mtDNA copies is presumed 
to be harmful7,11.
An alternative to the targeted destruction of mtDNA through 
double-strand breaks is precision genome editing, a capability that—
to the best of our knowledge—has not been previously reported for 
mtDNA. The ability to precisely install or correct pathogenic mutations 
could accelerate the modelling of diseases caused by mtDNA mutations, 
facilitate preclinical drug candidate testing, and potentially enable 
therapeutic approaches that directly correct pathogenic mtDNA muta-
tions. Although cytidine and adenosine deaminases are important for 
precision genome editing by enabling base editing in the nucleus1,2,13,14, 
their biochemical and functional diversity remain largely unexplored. 
Bacterial genomes contain various uncharacterized deaminases15, rais-
ing the possibility that some may possess unique activities that enable 
new genome-editing capabilities.

An interbacterial deaminase-like toxin

Some predicted bacterial deaminases contain sequences that suggest 
them to be substrates for intercellular protein delivery systems, such as 
the type VI secretion system (T6SS)15. This system mediates antagonism 
between Gram-negative bacteria by transferring antibacterial toxins 
into contacting cells16,17. Given their sequence divergence from char-
acterized deaminases, we sought to define the biochemical activity of 
T6SS-associated deaminases. We focused on a predicted deaminase 
belonging to the SCP1.201-like family15, henceforth referred to as DddA, 
encoded by Burkholderia cenocepacia (Fig. 1a). A B. cenocepacia strain 
lacking dddA and the downstream predicted immunity gene (dddIA) 
exhibited a marked growth defect when co-cultivated with the wild-type 
strain (Fig. 1b, Extended Data Fig. 1a, b). This defect was not observed 
in co-culture with a strain that lacked the activity of a T6SS (∆icmF1) or 
with a strain that expressed DddA containing an amino acid substitution 
of a predicted catalytic residue (dddAE1347A) . These data establish DddA 
as an antibacterial toxin that is delivered by the T6SS.
Members of the deaminase superfamily are known to catalyse the 
deamination of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), RNA, free nucleosides, 
nucleotides, nucleobases and other nucleotide derivatives15. To define the 
substrate of DddA, which belongs to a clade of predicted deaminases that 
lack a characterized member15, we first determined whether deaminases 
that represent the substrate range of the superfamily are toxic if expressed 
in bacteria. The growth of Escherichia coli was unaffected by the production 
of deaminases that act on ssDNA, tRNA or free cytidine (Fig. 1c, Extended 
Data Fig. 1c). By contrast, DddA markedly reduced the viability of E. coli 
(Fig. 1c). We identified amino acids 1264–1427 of DddA as the domain that 
confers toxicity, referred to henceforth as DddAtox (see Methods for details 
of the identification of the toxin domain). These findings suggested that 
DddA may act on a previously undescribed deaminase substrate.

DddA is a double-stranded DNA deaminase

To further clarify the substrate and mechanism of DddAtox, we deter-
mined a co-crystal structure of DddAtox bound to the immunity protein 
DddIA at 2.5 Å resolution (Supplementary Table 1). DddAtox adopts a 
typical deaminase fold consisting of a five-stranded β-sheet with but-
tressing helices that contribute catalytic residues (Fig. 1d). DddIA con-
tains a central β-sheet that occludes the active site of DddAtox (Fig. 1d). 
Structure-based homology searches revealed APOBEC enzymes as the 
closest structural relatives of DddAtox, with divergence at the C-terminal 
β-strands; these strands are antiparallel with an extended intervening 
loop in DddAtox, whereas they are parallel with an intervening α-helix 
in APOBEC enzymes (Fig. 1d, e).
So far, all reported DNA cytidine deaminases operate predominantly on 
ssDNA, often with a preference for the base immediately 5′ of the substrate 
C3. We measured the in vitro activity of DddAtox on a ssDNA substrate con-
taining cytosine in all four possible 5′-NC contexts. Whereas the activity of 
APOBEC3A was readily detected, DddAtox did not catalyse uracil formation 
within ssDNA sequences (Fig. 1f ). As a control, we included a related dsDNA 
substrate. Consistent with previous studies18, APOBEC3A did not display 
measurable activity against dsDNA. Unexpectedly, however, DddAtox 
efficiently converted cytosine to uracil within dsDNA (Fig. 1g, Extended 
Data Fig. 1d). The catalytically inactive enzyme, DddAtox(E1347A), showed 
no uracil formation, indicating that deamination was dependent on the 
activity of DddAtox. We did not detect deamination of single-stranded or 
double-stranded RNA substrates by DddAtox (Extended Data Fig. 1e, f ). 
These results collectively establish DddAtox as a cytidine deaminase that 
operates preferentially on dsDNA; the enzyme was therefore named 
‘double-stranded DNA deaminase toxin A’, or DddA.
If DddAtox converts cytosine to uracil specifically within dsDNA, the 
enzyme should be mutagenic in a manner that is dependent on uracil

DNA glycosylase (UDG), which initiates base excision repair through 
uracil removal19. Indeed, expression of sub-lethal levels of DddAtox in  
E. coli substantially increased the mutation frequency, and these 
mutagenic effects of DddAtox were enhanced more than 100-fold in an  
E. coli strain lacking UDG (Fig. 1h). We next used the high mutation rate 
caused by sub-lethal DddAtox levels to profile the sequence context 
preference of the enzyme. We performed whole-genome sequencing 
on five E. coli lineages that experienced serial DddAtox exposure and 
clonal bottlenecking, and five control strains that underwent a simi-
lar regimen in the presence of DddAtox(E1347A). Consistent with our 
mutation-frequency measurements, we observed approximately 50-fold 
more total single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in strains exposed 
to active DddAtox (997) than in strains producing the inactive enzyme 
(17), and more than 99% of the DddAtox-dependent SNPs were C•G-to-T•A 
transitions (Extended Data Fig. 2a–c). The alignment of sequences flank-
ing the converted cytosine within these C•G-to-T•A mutations revealed 
a strong preference for 5′-TC contexts (Fig. 1i), matching the sequence 
preference of the enzyme in vitro (Extended Data Fig. 2d). Together, these 
findings reveal that DddAtox deaminates dsDNA substrates in vitro and 
in bacterial cells with a preference for 5′-TC contexts.

Splitting DddAtox into non-toxic halves

Current base editors deaminate nucleotides in ssDNA loops created by 
RNA-guided CRISPR proteins1,13,14. The ability of DddAtox to deaminate 
cytidines in dsDNA raises the possibility of using RNA-free program-
mable dsDNA-binding proteins, such as zinc-finger arrays20 or TALE 
repeat arrays21, to direct DddAtox to mtDNA targets without requiring 
CRISPR or guide RNAs.
As expected (Fig. 1b, c), the expression of intact DddAtox fused to 
programmable DNA-binding proteins was toxic to human HEK293T 

cells (Supplementary Discussion). To avoid this toxicity, we proposed 
splitting the protein into two inactive halves, one containing the N ter-
minus of DddAtox (DddAtox-N) and the other containing the C terminus 
(DddAtox-C). These halves would reconstitute deamination activity only 
when assembled adjacently on target DNA, analogous to the assembly 
of FokI monomers to reconstitute dsDNA nuclease activity in zinc finger 
nucleases20 and TALENs21.
On the basis of the DddAtox–DddIA co-crystal structure, we split DddAtox 
into DddAtox-N and DddAtox-C halves at seven sites within loops (Fig. 2a), 
naming each split to reflect the last residue of DddAtox-N. Screening of 
split sites was performed with CRISPR–Cas9 proteins to facilitate testing 
of split DddAtox variants directed to target DNA half-sites with different 
spacing region lengths22 (Supplementary Table 2). Each DddAtox half was 
fused to the N terminus of dSpCas923 or an orthogonal Staphylococcus 
aureus Cas9 variant (SaKKH-Cas9)24. Each split was assayed in its two 
possible fusion orientations: SaKKH-Cas9 fused either to DddAtox-N 
(‘aureus-N’) or to DddAtox-C (‘aureus-C’) (Fig. 2b, c). The top DNA strand 
of test sites contained more TC motifs than the bottom strand and was 
therefore more likely to be edited by DddAtox (Extended Data Fig. 3). To 
enhance edits at target sites, we used SaKKH-Cas9(D10A) nickase25to 
nick the bottom strand, in order to promote its resynthesis using the 
edited top DNA strand as a template13,14,26,27.
Among active split-DddAtox–Cas9 fusions, we observed C•G-to-T•A 
conversions in the spacing region between the two protospacers 
(Fig. 2d, Extended Data Fig. 3). All editing efficiencies in this study 
report the fraction of sequenced alleles with the desired C•G-to-T•A 
edit among all treated cells with no enrichment. Notably, we observed 
no on-target editing in the absence of guide RNAs or when only one 
DddAtox–Cas9 half and its guide RNA were present (Supplementary 
Table 3), indicating that editing is strictly dependent on the reassembly 
of both DddAtox halves at the Cas9-specified target site.

Among the seven splits tested, splits at G1333 and G1397 yielded 
the highest editing efficiencies of 22%–48% at the most highly edited 
position within the target spacing region (Extended Data Fig. 3b, g, h, 
Supplementary Discussion). For a given fusion orientation, the editing 
efficiencies of target bases were dependent on their positions within 
the spacing region; for example, G1397 aureus-C yielded 20%–22% edit-
ing at a target TC14 (the 14th nucleotide of the spacing region between 
the two target protospacers) within 17- and 23-bp spacing regions, and 
41% within a 44-bp spacing region (Fig. 2d). These results collectively 
suggest that splitting DddAtox at G1333 and G1397 produces halves 
that reconstitute at a target site to mediate C•G-to-T•A conversion 
in human cells. Spacing region length, target cytosine position and 
split orientation are all determinants of the base-editing efficiency 
of split-DddAtox.

Nuclear base editing by TALE–DddAtox

Because DddAtox split at G1333 or G1397 can deaminate target TCs within 
a modest spacing region (Supplementary Discussion), we speculated 
that fusing split DddAtox halves to TALE array proteins that bind neigh-
bouring DNA sites might result in CRISPR-free, RNA-free base editing 
in human cells.

We fused DddAtox halves split at G1333 to TALE array proteins con-
taining a bipartite nuclear localization signal (bpNLS) to bind nuclear 
DNA sequences flanking an 18-bp spacing region within CCR5 in U2OS 
cells (Extended Data Fig. 4a). Compared with simple fusions that do not 
contain a uracil glycosylase inhibitor (UGI), appending two copies of 
UGI (2×-UGI)14,28 to the N terminus increased the editing efficiency at C9 
by approximately 8-fold (to 22%–27%) and reduced indels to less than 
2.3 ± 0.31% (mean ± s.d.). Fusing 2×-UGI to the C terminus through a 2- or 
a 16-amino-acid linker resulted in lower editing efficiencies of 12 ± 3.5% or 
3.3 ± 1.3%, respectively (Extended Data Fig. 4a). These results collectively 
demonstrate that split DddAtox can be fused to TALE arrays to mediate 
C•G-to-T•A conversions in human nuclear DNA, and that fusing UGI to these 
proteins enhances editing efficiencies and reduces indel byproducts14,28.

Mitochondrial base editing by TALE–DddAtox

To apply TALE–split DddAtox fusions for mitochondrial base editing, 
we fused split DddAtox halves to MTS-linked TALE proteins that target 
MT-ND69, a mitochondrial gene that encodes the NADH dehydroge-
nase 6 subunit of complex I (Supplementary Table 4). Among fusions 
that did not contain UGI, we observed the highest level of mtDNA 
target editing (4.9 ± 0.17%) for the architecture that comprised the

C-terminal half of DddAtox split at G1397 and bound to the right TALE 
assembled with the N-terminal half of DddAtox split at G1397 and 
bound to the left TALE (Right–G1397-C + Left–G1397-N; Extended Data  
Fig. 5a, b).
In contrast to nuclear-localized TALE–DddAtox, fusing one or two 
UGI proteins to the N terminus of each mitoTALE–DddAtox half did not 
enhance C•G-to-T•A conversion. Appending one UGI to the C terminus, 
however, increased editing levels by three- to tenfold compared with con-
structs that lacked UGI (up to 16%–27% for C6, C7 and C13 in TC contexts). 
Adding a second copy of UGI to the C terminus did not further increase 
mtDNA editing efficiencies (Fig. 3a). UGI probably inhibits mitochon-
drial UNG1 to enhance editing efficiencies by impeding uracil excision29. 
Removing the MTS sequences or replacing them with a bpNLS was found 
to abrogate editing, demonstrating that MT-ND6 editing is dependent on 
the mitochondrial localization of the mitoTALE–DddAtox fusions (Fig. 3a).
Fluorescence microscopy images revealed that, whereas MTS–
mitoTALE–split-DddAtox–UGI fusions localized to the mitochondria 
in HeLa cells, MTS–UGI–mitoTALE–split-DddAtox fusions remained 
diffused throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 3b). These findings explain 
the observed dependence of editing efficiency on the position of 
UGI fusion and suggest that proximity between the MTS and an 
N-terminal UGI may impede mitochondrial import of the fusion  
protein.
These results collectively suggested the following optimized mito-
TALE–split-DddAtox architecture (in N- to C-terminus order): an MTS, a 

TALE array, a two-amino-acid linker, a DddAtox half from the G1333 or G1397 
split, and one UGI protein (Fig. 3c). This architecture, hereafter referred 
to as DddA-derived cytosine base editor (DdCBE), represents—to our 
knowledge—the first agent that is capable of performing precise genome 
editing in mtDNA. The application of DdCBE contrasts with previously 
reported uses of nucleases to make double-strand breaks in mtDNA, which 
result in the loss of targeted mtDNA copies and in heteroplasmic shifts8–10.
Given that DddAtox can edit cytosines on either DNA strand, inter-
mediates that contain uracils on opposing DNA strands could produce 
double-strand breaks during DNA repair, causing unwanted indels. 
Although the standard cytosine base editor BE4max30—when targeted 
to EMX1 in the nucleus—resulted in 1.8 ± 0.67% indels in HEK293T cells, 
indels were not detected (less than 0.1%) at MT-ND6 despite DdCBE edit-
ing both mtDNA strands (Fig. 3c, Extended Data Fig. 4b, c). Indeed, we 
observed very high product purities (at least 99.5%) for DdCBE-mediated 
mtDNA base editing of MT-ND6 in HEK293T cells and in U2OS cells—
exceeding the product purities resulting from the editing of CCR5 by 
nuclear-targeted BE4max (96 ± 0.78%) and by nuclear-targeted DdCBE 
(95 ± 0.52%) (Fig. 3d, Extended Data Fig. 4d). These results suggest that 
the DNA repair processes that lead to indels and other byproducts in 
nuclear DNA19 are inefficient in mitochondria (Supplementary Discus-
sion; see Fig. 3e for MT-ND6 allele frequencies in HEK293T cells after 
treatment with MT-ND6-DdCBE, denoted as ND6-DdCBE). Instead, 
lesion-containing mtDNA is degraded rather than repaired11, resulting 
in the selective maintenance of cleanly edited mtDNA copies.

These findings establish a precision mtDNA editing platform, which 
uses a dsDNA-specific cytidine deaminase that is split to mitigate toxicity, 
programmable dsDNA-binding TALE arrays localized to the mitochon-
dria, and a UGI to achieve RNA-free base editing in the mitochondria.

Base editing of five mtDNA genes

To explore the generality of DdCBE for mtDNA editing, we engineered or 
adapted seven pairs of TALE arrays (Supplementary Table 4) to target five 
mitochondrial genes: MT-ND1, MT-ND2, MT-ND4, MT-ND5 and MT-ATP8.
Three to six days after treatment, mitochondrial base-editing effi-
ciencies of DdCBEs in HEK293T cells varied between 4.6% and 49% 
depending on the split type, split orientation and target cytosine posi-
tion within the spacing region. For DdCBEs using the G1333 split, the 
Right–G1333-C + Left–G1333-N orientation resulted in 2.1- to 15-fold 
higher editing efficiencies than the Right–G1333-N + Left–G1333-C 
orientation, regardless of the spacing length and positions of TC tar-
get bases (Fig. 4a–e, g). By contrast, the effect of split orientation on 
editing efficiencies was more site-dependent for G1397 (Fig. 4b, d–f ).
Collectively, optimized G1397-split DdCBEs mediated average 
base-editing efficiencies of 42% at each of four well-edited mtDNA sites 
(Fig. 4a–c, e) and average efficiencies of 9.0% at two modestly edited 
sites (Fig. 4d, f ), whereas the most efficient G1333-split DdCBEs yielded 
43% average conversion at three sites (Fig. 4a–c) and 7.4% average effi-
ciencies at three other sites (Fig. 4d, e, g). We did not detect indels or 
base editing outside the spacing region (Supplementary Tables 5, 6).
Within 14–18-bp spacing regions, G1397-split DdCBE preferen-
tially edited TCs that were positioned approximately 4–7 nucleotides 
upstream of the 3′ end of the spacing region in either mtDNA strand. By

contrast, G1333-split DdCBE preferentially edited TCs that were posi-
tioned approximately 4–10 nucleotides from the 5′ end of the spacing 
region in either mtDNA strand (Fig. 4h). These results indicate that each 
split edits TCs with a preference for specific windows in the spacing 
region. For a given target sequence, we recommend testing G1397 and 
G1333 splits in both orientations, using spacing lengths and TALE-binding 
sites guided by the above principles (Supplementary Discussion).
We confirmed the durability of mtDNA edits in HEK293T cells over 18 
days (Extended Data Fig. 6a–d, Supplementary Discussion). In addition, 
mtDNA editing did not reduce cell viability, produced no large mtDNA 
deletions, and did not perturb mtDNA copy numbers (Extended Data 
Fig. 6g–i, Supplementary Discussion). We observed a substantial reduc-
tion in editing when mtDNA replication was blocked by induced expres-
sion of a dominant negative mitochondrial polymerase gamma mutant31 
(Extended Data Fig. 7). We speculate that during mtDNA replication, repli-
cative polymerases incorporate A opposite U to resolve the U•G intermedi-
ate into a T•A base pair. DdCBE-mediated mtDNA editing in non-dividing 
cells should be feasible because mtDNA replication proceeds even in 
post-mitotic cells32. Indeed, untransformed primary human fibroblasts 
also supported efficient mtDNA base editing (typically 30%–40%) (Fig. 4i) 
despite dividing much less frequently than HEK293T cells, indicating that 
the use of DdCBE is not limited to immortalized cell lines.
Given that mutations in mtDNA genes that encode complex I subunits 
are thought to be pathogenic in rare tumours of the thyroid and kidney6,33, 
we investigated the consequences of editing MT-ND4 in cells containing 
the m.11922G>A mutation (for the characterization of other edited sites, 
see Extended Data Fig. 8c–f and Supplementary Discussion). Compared 
with control cells treated with catalytically inactive DdCBE, cells treated 
with ND4-DdCBE had lower rates of oxidative phosphorylation (Fig. 4j) 
and decreased basal and uncoupled respiration rates (Fig. 4k)—consistent 
with the disruption of complex I. Mitochondrial DNA homeostasis and 
associated transcripts were unchanged (Extended Data Fig. 8a, b). Also 
consistent with a specific defect in complex I, the enzymatic activity and 
assembly of complex I—but not of complex IV—were markedly reduced 
in these cells (Fig. 4l, m). These results establish that precise DdCBE 
editing can be applied to study mitochondrial phenotypes arising from 
disease-associated mtDNA mutations.

Off-target editing by DdCBEs

To profile the off-target activity of DdCBE in the human mitochondrial 
genome, we transfected HEK293T cells with plasmids that constitutively 
expressed optimized DdCBE or the corresponding dead-DdCBE con-
trol in order to distinguish DdCBE-induced single-nucleotide variants 
(SNVs) from background heteroplasmy. To test for possible editing 
arising as a result of the spontaneous assembly of split DddAtox in the 
absence of TALE-directed DNA binding, cells were also transfected with 
plasmids expressing MTS–G1397 split–UGI, with no TALE array (Fig. 5a).
The average frequencies of mitochondrial genome-wide off-target 
C•G-to-T•A editing by MTND5P2-DdCBE (denoted as ND5.2-DdCBE), 
ND4-DdCBE and ATP8-DdCBE (0.030%–0.034%) were similar to those 
of the untreated and dead-DdCBE controls (0.024%–0.030%), whereas 
MTND5P1-DdCBE (denoted as ND5.1-DdCBE) had a 1.6-fold higher aver-
age off-target editing frequency (0.049%) compared with the untreated 
control (Fig. 5b). We attribute the unusually high average off-target 
editing frequency by ND6-DdCBE (0.13%) to the permissive mutant 
N-terminal domain (NTD) of TALE (Fig. 3a), which may increase the 
non-specific binding of TALE arrays. Off-target mutations from the 
spontaneous reassembly of TALE-free split DddAtox were not detected 
at greater levels than in untreated cells (Fig. 5b). Notably, we did not 
observe significant off-target editing at nuclear pseudogenes, even 
though they differ by only 1–2 bp from the mtDNA on-target sites 
(Extended Data Fig. 9).
DdCBEs with standard NTDs generally exhibited 150- to 860-fold 
higher on-target editing relative to off-target editing, with no strong 

correlation between on-target editing efficiencies and off-target activ-
ity (Supplementary Table 8). Because all of these standard DdCBEs 
exhibit similar protein expression levels (Extended Data Fig. 6f ) and 
share wild-type NTDs and deaminase domains but have different TALE 
repeats, we conclude that TALE domains influence off-target activity. 
Moreover, TALE–split DddA fusions must be positioned in close prox-
imity for both on-target and off-target editing (Extended Data Fig. 10).
To further investigate the nature of off-target edits (see Extended 
Data Fig. 11 for predicted effect of off-target SNVs on protein function), 
we searched the 20-bp regions flanking each off-target SNV for any 
sequence homology to the on-target TALE-binding sites. Although we 
noted a strong 5′-TC-3′ preference for ND6-DdCBE and ND5.1-DdCBE 
off-target edits that matches the sequence preference for free DddAtox 
in E. coli (Fig. 1i, Supplementary Discussion), we did not observe any 
consensus off-target sequences that closely resemble on-target TALE 
binding sites (Fig. 5c). In addition, up to 20%–80% of SNVs identified 
for each DdCBE overlapped with those of other DdCBEs containing 
distinct TALE arrays programmed to bind different on-target sites 
(Supplementary Data 2, Supplementary Table 9). Collectively, these 
results suggest that off-target editing does not arise from editing at 
sequences similar to on-target sites. Instead, we speculate that DdCBE 
halves containing TALE arrays with greater non-specific DNA binding 
activity34 are more likely to bind proximally to transiently reassemble 
active DddAtox, which can then engage off-target mtDNA regions with 
no necessary homology to the on-target site.

Discussion

This study describes an interbacterial cytidine deaminase toxin specific for 
dsDNA, and its development into a CRISPR-free, RNA-free base editor that 
can install targeted mutations in the human mitochondrial genome with 
typical efficiencies ranging between 5% and 50%. The resulting DdCBEs 
enable programmable C•G-to-T•A conversions in mtDNA without requiring 
double-strand breaks, a capability that has the potential to model mito-
chondrial disease mutations, correct pathogenic variants (Supplementary 
Table 10) and expand our knowledge of mitochondrial biology.
Additional research will be needed to fully elucidate the principles 
that govern the efficiency and specificity of DdCBE. Developing in vitro 
and in vivo strategies to deliver DdCBEs will be essential for exploring 
their therapeutic potential in other cell types and in animal models 
of mitochondrial diseases. Exploring additional sources of natural 
diversity among bacterial DNA deaminases, or engineering DddA-
tox variants with altered sequence context and substrate preferences 
beyond 5′-TC-3′, would further expand the scope of mtDNA editing. 
Finally, although this study has focused on the use of DdCBE for mito-
chondrial base editing, some features of DdCBE (or zinc-finger array 
variants35)—such as its all-protein composition, its lack of requirement 
for a protospacer adjacent motif, and its independence from CRISPR 
components—may also offer advantages for base editing in cells and 
organelles beyond mitochondria.

Methods

No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. The 
experiments were not randomized and the investigators were not 
blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment.

Bacterial strains and culture conditions
Unless otherwise noted, all bacterial strains used in this study were 
grown in Lysogeny Broth (LB) at 37 °C or on LB medium solidified with 
agar (LBA, 1.5% w/v, except as noted). When required, media was sup-
plemented with the following: carbenicillin (150 μg ml−1) gentamycin (15 
μg ml−1), IPTG (80 μM, except as noted), rhamnose (0.05% w/v, except 
as noted), chloramphenicol (10 μg ml−1) or tetracycline (20 μg ml−1 for 
E. coli, 120 μg ml−1 for B. cenocepacia). E. coli strains DH5α, XK1502 and 
BL21 were used for plasmid maintenance, toxicity and mutagenesis 
assays, and protein expression, respectively. B. cenocepacia strains 
were derived from the cystic fibrosis clinical isolate H111. A detailed 
description of the bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study is 
provided in Supplementary Table 11.

Genetic techniques and plasmid construction for bacterial 
expression
All procedures for DNA manipulation and transformation were per-
formed with standard methods. Molecular biology reagents, Phusion 
high fidelity DNA polymerase, restriction enzymes, and Gibson Assem-
bly Reagent were obtained from New England Biolabs (NEB). GoTaq 
Green Master Mix was obtained from Promega. Primers and gBlocks 
used in this study were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies 
(IDT). A list of all primers used in bacterial studies is provided in Sup-
plementary Table 12.
Protein expression constructs were generated by Gibson assembly. 
The toxin domain of DddA was identified by remote homology with 
characterized deaminase domains identified through HMMER36. For 
functional protein expression assays of DddAtox, TadA and CDD, the 
relevant genes or gene fragments were amplified from B. cenocepacia 
(DddAtox) or E. coli genomic DNA and cloned into the vector pSCRhaB2. 
The gene encoding DddIA was amplified from B. cenocepacia and cloned 
into pPSV39, and the expression construct for DddAtox(E1347A) was 
generated by overlap extension PCR followed by Gibson assembly 
with pSCRhaB2. For the APOBEC3G expression construct, the gene 
sequence was codon optimized for expression in E. coli, generated by 
synthesis as a gBLOCK (IDT) and cloned into pSCRhaB2. For protein 
purification, genes encoding DddAtox and DddAI were amplified from 
B. cenocepacia and cloned into pETDuet.
In-frame gene deletions and nucleotide substitutions in B. ceno-
cepacia were performed by homologous recombination using the 
plasmid pDONRPEX18Tp-SceI-pheS, followed by counter-selection 
using the plasmid pDAI-SceI and plasmid curing using 0.1% (w/v) 
p-chlorophenylalanine, as described previously37. B. cenocepacia 
contains two complete T6SSs38 and both were inactivated (∆icmF1, 
I35_RS01770; ∆icmF2, I35_RS17395) and tested in this study. The 
∆icmF2 mutation did not influence DddA-dependent intercellular 
intoxication and is thus not included in Fig. 1b for the sake of brev-
ity. Gentamycin-resistant B. cenocepacia was generated by insertion 
of a resistance cassette at the Tn7 site attachment site as described 
previously39.

Plasmid construction for mammalian expression
PCR was performed using Phusion U Green Multiplex PCR Master Mix 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific), Phusion U Green Hot Start DNA Polymerase 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) or Q5 Hot Start High-Fidelity DNA Polymer-
ase (New England Biolabs). All plasmids were constructed using USER 
cloning (New England Biolabs). DddAtox and mitoTALE genes were syn-
thesized as gene blocks and codon optimized for human expression 
(Genscript). BE4max was obtained according to a previous report30. 

BE2max (rAPOBEC1–dSpCas9–UGI–UGI) was cloned from a BE4max 
plasmid. Compared with BE214, BE2max contains an extra UGI protein 
and uses codon optimization from BE4max. DddAtox–Cas9 fusions and 
DdCBE variants were cloned into pCMV (mammalian codon-optimized) 
backbones. sgRNA plasmids were constructed by blunt-end ligation of 
a linear polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product generated by encod-
ing the 20- to 23-nt variable protospacer sequence onto the 5′ end of an 
amplification primer and treating the resulting piece with KLD Enzyme 
Mix (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 
Mach1 chemically competent E. coli cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific) 
were used for plasmid construction. E. coli strain DH5α:dddI was used to 
construct intact DddAtox–Cas9 plasmids. Plasmids for mammalian trans-
fection were purified using ZymoPURE II Plasmid Midiprep Kits (Zymo 
Research), as previously described40. A list of all primers used in mam-
malian expression constructs is provided in Supplementary Table 13.

Bacterial competition experiments
Bacterial competition experiments were used to evaluate the fitness of 
B. cenocepacia strains in interbacterial interactions. Donor and recipi-
ent strains were grown overnight and mixed in a 10:1 (v/v) ratio for donor 
and recipient, respectively. Cell suspensions were then concentrated to 
a total optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 10, and 10 μl was spotted on a 
0.2 μm nitrocellulose membrane placed on LBA (3% w/v) and incubated 
for 6 h at 37 °C. After incubation, cells were scraped from the membrane 
surface and resuspended in 1 ml LB. The initial donor:recipient ratio 
and the post-incubation ratio were determined by plating on LB agar 
(LBA) to determine the total number of colony forming units (cfu) and 
on LBA with gentamycin to quantify cfu of the recipient strain.

Toxicity assays
To evaluate the toxicity of deaminases expressed heterologously, over-
night cultures of E. coli XK1502 containing the appropriate plasmids 
were diluted 1:1,000 into fresh medium and grown until they reached 
exponential phase (OD600 0.6), at which point deaminase expression 
was induced with rhamnose (0.2% w/v). Aliquots of cultures were then 
collected periodically until 480 min of growth and were diluted and 
plated onto LBA for c.f.u determination.

Crystallization and structure determination
Crystals of the selenomethionine derivative hexahistidine-tagged 
DddAtox (aa 1264–1427)·DddIA complex were obtained at 5–10 mg 
ml−1 in crystallization buffer (15 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1.0 mM 
tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP)), mixed 1:1 with crystallization 
solution containing 25% (w/v) PEG 3350, 0.1 M Bis-Tris:HCl pH 6.5,  
200 mM MgCl2. Rectangular crystals grew to 400 × 200 × 100 μm over  
5 days. Selenomethionine DddAtox·DddIA crystals displayed the 
symmetry of space group P21212 (a = 126.8 Å, b = 145.0 Å, c = 64.2 Å, 
α = β = γ = 90°), with four dimers in the asymmetric unit. Before data 
collection, crystals were cryoprotected in crystallization solution  
(15% glycerol, 25% PEG3350, 100 mM MgCl2, 100 mM NaCl, 7.5 mM Tris 
pH 7.5, 50 mM Bis-Tris pH 6.5, 0.5 mM TCEP).
Highly redundant anomalous (SAD) data were obtained at 0.9790 Å  
(peak) wavelength from a single selenomethionine crystal at 100 K 
temperature at the BL502 beamline (ALS, Lawrence Berkeley National 
Laboratory). Data were processed using HKL200041. Heavy-atom 
searching using phenix.autosol identified 18 possible sites, and refine-
ment yielded an estimated Bayes correlation coefficient of 55.9 to 2.5 Å 
resolution. After density modification, the estimated Bayes correlation 
coefficient increased to 61.2. Approximately 70% of the selenomethio-
nine model was constructed automatically, and the remaining portion 
was built manually. The current model (Supplementary Table 1) con-
tains four DddA·DddIA dimers.
Refinement was carried out against peak anomalous data with 
Bijvoet pairs kept separate using phenix.refine42 interspersed with 
manual model revisions using the program Coot43 and consisted of 

conjugate-gradient minimization and calculation of individual atomic 
displacement and translation/libration/screw parameters44. Residues 
that could not be identified in the electron density were: 1250–1289 and 
1423–1427 for DddA, and 71–73 for DddIA. Both models exhibit excel-
lent geometry, as determined by MolProbity45. Ramachandran analysis 
identified 99.1% favoured, 0.9% allowed and 0% disallowed residues 
for the model. Coordinates and structure factors are deposited in the 
RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB ID: 6U08).

Mutation frequency determination and SNP generation assay
To determine the frequency of mutations induced by expression of 
DddAtox and DddAtox(E1347A), overnight cultures of E. coli containing 
the expression plasmids for these proteins together with the plasmid 
for expression of DddIA were diluted 1:1,000 into fresh medium and 
grown until they reached the exponential phase (OD600 0.6). The cul-
tures were then induced with IPTG (80 μM) for DddIA and rhamnose 
(0.04% w/v) for DddAtox or DddAtox(E1347A) expression. The combined 
expression of both toxin and immunity proteins at this low level ena-
bles the cells expressing DddAtox to suffer growth arrest but does not 
result in a decrease in culture viability. After 1 h under these inducing 
conditions, cultures were supplemented with 1 mM of IPTG to increase 
DddIA expression and thus block DddA toxicity and were then grown 
for an additional 16 h. After this recovery period, the cultures were 
plated onto LBA containing rifampicin (100 μg ml−1) or no antibiotics. 
Mutation frequency was determined dividing the number of rifampicin 
resistant colonies by the total c.f.u obtained on non-selective medium.
For the genome-wide identification of SNPs that accumulate after low 
level expression of DddAtox or DddAtox(E1347A), E. coli Δudg strain car-
rying plasmids for expression of one of these proteins plus the plasmid 
for expressing DddIA was submitted to seven rounds of expression and 
recovery as described above, with cultures being plated after recovery 
and single colonies being selected and used to inoculate the subsequent 
round of expression. Randomly chosen single colonies were used to 
avoid introducing selection for increased fitness under the culture 
conditions46. Five isolated colonies from each starting population 
subjected to this regimen were selected for whole genome sequenc-
ing. We confirmed the presence of non-mutagenized DddAtox and 
DddAtox(E1347A) in these sequencing data.

Western blot for deaminase expression in E. coli
Western blotting to detect deaminases expressed in E. coli was per-
formed using rabbit anti-VSV-G (diluted 1:5,000, Sigma) and detected 
with anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary anti-
bodies (diluted 1:5,000, Sigma). Loading control was performed with 
mouse anti-RNAP (diluted 1:500, BioLegend) and detected with sheep 
anti-mouse (diluted 1:500, Millipore). Western blots were developed 
using chemiluminescent substrate (SuperSignal West Pico Substrate, 
Thermo Scientific) and imaged with a C600 imager (Azure Biosystems).

Western blot for deaminase expression in mammalian cells
HEK293T cells were transfected as described below. For preparation of 
cell lysate for western blot analysis of DdCBE, cells were lysed in 150 μl 
of ice-cold 1x RIPA buffer (Sigma) with added protease inhibitor (Roche 
Complete Mini) by incubating for 30 min at 4 °C with agitation. Lysates 
were cleared by pelleting at 12,000g for 10 min at 4 °C.
Next, 60 μl of cleared lysate supernatant was added to 20 μl of 4X 
LDS sample loading buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with a final DTT 
(Sigma Aldrich) concentration of 10 mM. Lysates were boiled for 10 
min at 95 °C. Then 15–20 μl of protein lysate was loaded into the wells 
of a Bolt 4–12% Bis-Tris Plus (Thermo Fisher Scientific) pre-cast gel. 6 μl  
of Precision Plus Protein Dual Colour Standard (Bio-Rad) was used as 
a reference. Samples were separated by electrophoresis at 180 V for  
45 min in Bolt MES SDS running buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Trans-
fer to a PVDF membrane was performed using an iBlot 2 Gel Transfer 
Device (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s 

protocols. The membrane was blocked in Odyssey Blocking Buffer 
(LI-COR) for 1 h at room temperature, then incubated with rat anti-Flag 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific MA1-142; 1:2,000 dilution), mouse anti-HA 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific 26183; 1:2,000 dilution) and rabbit anti-actin 
(CST 4970; 1:2,000 dilution) in blocking buffer (0.5% Tween-20 in 1x 
PBS, 0.2 μm filtered) overnight at 4 °C. The membrane was washed 
three times with TBST (1x TBS in 0.5% Tween-20, 0.2-μm filtered) for 
10 min each at room temperature, then incubated with IRDye-labelled 
secondary antibodies goat anti-rat 680RD (LI-COR 926-68076), goat 
anti-mouse 800CW (LI-COR 926-32210) and donkey anti-rabbit 800CW 
(LI-COR 926–32213) diluted 1:5,000 in blocking buffer for 1 h at room 
temperature. The membrane was washed as before, then imaged using 
an Odyssey Imaging System (LI-COR).

Mitochondria isolation and blue-native-PAGE analysis
Mitochondria isolation was performed as described47. Cells were col-
lected from the plates by pipetting in NKM buffer (1 mM Tris–HCl,  
pH 7.4, 130 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 7.5 mM MgCl2) followed by centrifu-
gation at 400g at 4 °C for 8 min. Pellets were resuspended in ice-cold 
0.1x homogenization buffer (4 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 2.5 mM NaCl, 
0.5 mM MgCl2) and incubated for 5 min on ice. Twenty strokes of a 
tight-fitting pestle (Dounce homogenizer) were applied to homog-
enize cells and buffer was adjusted to isotonic conditions by addition of 
one-ninth volume of 10x homogenization buffer. Cell debris and nuclei 
were pelleted by two succeeding centrifugations at 900g at 4 °C for  
4 min and mitochondria were collected by centrifugation at 10,000g at 
4 °C for 2 min. Then 50 μg of mitochondria were suspended in Native-
PAGE solubilization buffer (Thermo Fisher) with addition of digitonin 
at a ratio of 4 g digitonin per g protein and incubated on ice for 10 min. 
Samples were centrifuged 16,000g at 4 °C for 10 min, supernatants were 
collected to new tubes and NativePAGE G-250 Sample Additive (Thermo 
Fisher) was added to each sample to a final concentration of 0.25%. 
Samples were loaded onto NativePAGE 3–12% Bis-Tris Gels (Thermo 
Fisher) and electrophoresis was performed with the use of NativePAGE 
Running Buffer system (Thermo Fisher) at constant 150 V for 45 min 
at 4 °C followed by 250 V for 90 min at room temperature. After initial 
45 min electrophoresis, the Dark Blue Cathode Buffer was replaced 
with the Light Blue Cathode Buffer. After electrophoresis, transfer 
to a PVDF membrane (BioRad) was performed using semi-dry Trans 
Blot Turbo transfer system (BioRad). Membranes were incubated for 
5 min in 8% v/v acetic acid and washed briefly with methanol following 
5 min incubation in distilled H2O. Membranes were washed twice with 
TBST (TBS-Tween-20, Boston BioProducts) and blocked with 5% w/v 
Blotting-Grade Blocker (BioRad) in TBST. Membranes were incubated 
with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C (mouse anti-NDUFA9, Abcam 
14713, 1:1,000 dilution; rabbit anti-UQCRC2, Abcam 103616, 1:1,000 
dilution; mouse anti-ATP5A, Abcam 14748, 1:6,000 dilution; mouse 
anti-MTCO2, Abcam 110258, 1:1,000 dilution; mouse anti-SDHB, Abcam 
14714, 1:1,000 dilution). Membranes were washed 3 times for 10 min 
with TBST and incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 h at room tem-
perature followed by washing 3 times for 10 min with TBST. Membranes 
were incubated with Western Lightning Plus-ECL (PerkinElmer) and 
signal was registered on the Amersham Hyperfilm high performance 
autoradiography film (GE Healthcare). Films were scanned and 8-bit 
greyscale files were used for quantification with Fiji software48. For 
each image, a region of interest of the same size was used to quantify 
all bands and their corresponding background signals. Obtained values 
were inverted so that white pixels = 0 and black pixels = 255. Net values 
were calculated as a difference between band values and background 
values. Obtained net values were used to calculate the protein ratio of 
ND4-DdCBE-treated cells relative to mock-edited cells.

Purification of proteins for bacterial biochemical assays
Overnight cultures of E. coli BL21 pETDuet-1::dddAtox-dddIA, or E. coli 
BL21 pETDuet-1::dddAtox(E1347A) were used to inoculate 2 l of LB broth 

in a 1:100 dilution and cultures were grown to approximately OD600 0.6. 
At this point, plasmid expression was induced with 0.5 mM IPTG and 
the cultures were incubated for 16 h at 18 °C in a shaking incubator. Cell 
pellets were collected by centrifugation at 4,000g for 20 min, followed 
by resuspension in 50 ml of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 500 mM 
NaCl, 30 mM imidazole, 1 mM DTT, and 1 mg ml−1 lysozyme). Cell pellets 
were then lysed by sonication (5 pulses, 10 s each) and supernatant was 
separated by centrifugation at 25,000g for 30 min.
The DddAtox–DddIA complex or DddAtox(E1347A) was purified from cell 
lysates by nickel affinity chromatography using 4 ml of Ni-NTA agarose 
beads loaded onto a gravity-flow column. The supernatant was loaded 
onto the column and resin was washed with 50 ml of wash buffer (50 mM  
Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 30 mM imidazole, 1 mM DTT). Pro-
teins of interest were eluted with 5 ml elution buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl  
pH 7.5, 300 mM imidazole, 500 mM NaCl, 30 mM imidazole, 1 mM DTT). 
When DddAtox(E1347A) was purified, the eluted samples were applied 
directly to size-exclusion chromatography. For DddA–DddIA, the eluted 
samples underwent a denaturation and renaturation step to isolate only 
the toxin. In this case, the eluted proteins were added to 50 ml 8 M urea 
denaturing buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 300 mM imidazole, 500 mM 
NaCl and 1 mM DTT) and incubated for 16 h at 4 °C. The 8 M urea denatur-
ing buffer with the eluted proteins was loaded on a gravity-flow column 
with 4 ml Ni-NTA agarose beads. The column was washed with 50 ml 8 M 
urea denaturing buffer to remove any remaining DddIA. While still bound 
to Ni-NTA agarose beads, DddAtox was renatured by sequential washes 
with 25 ml denaturing buffer with decreasing concentrations of urea  
(6 M, 4 M, 2 M, 1 M), and a last wash with wash buffer to remove remaining 
traces of urea. Proteins bound to the column were then eluted with 5 ml 
elution buffer. The eluted samples were purified again by size-exclusion 
chromatography using fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) with 
gel filtration on a Superdex200 column (GE Healthcare) in sizing buffer 
(20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 5% (w/v) glycerol). The 
fraction purity was evaluated by SDS–PAGE gel stained with Coomassie 
blue and the highest quality factions were stored at −80 °C.

DNA deamination assays
All the DNA substrates were purchased from IDT, and a 6-FAM fluoro-
phore was added for visualization (see Supplementary Table 12 for 
substrate sequences). Reactions were performed in 10 μl of deamina-
tion buffer (20 mM MES pH 6.4, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 8% Ficoll 70 
and 1 μM substrate) with APOBEC3A, DddAtox or DddAtox(E1347A) at the 
concentrations indicated in Fig. 1f, g and Extended Data Fig. 1d. Reac-
tions were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, followed by the addition of 5 μl of 
UDG solution (New England Biolabs, 0.02 U μl−1 UDG in 1X UDG buffer) 
and further incubated for 30 min. Cleavage of substrates was induced 
by addition of 100 mM NaOH and incubation at 95 °C for 3 min. Samples 
were analysed by denaturing 15% acrylamide gel electrophoresis and 
the resulting fluorescent DNA fragments were detected by fluorescence 
imaging with Azure Biosystems.

Poisoned primer extension assay for RNA deamination
All substrate sequences are listed in Supplementary Table 12. The RNA 
substrates and the oligonucleotide containing a 5′ 6-FAM fluorophore 
for visualization were purchased from IDT. Deamination reactions were 
performed in 10 μl of RNA deamination buffer (Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 200 mM 
NaCl, 1 mM DTT) with the addition of 1 μM of DddAtox or DddAtox(E1347A). 
Substrate combinations and concentrations were added as indicated in 
Extended Data Fig. 1e, f, and reactions were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. 
cDNA synthesis was performed in a 10-μl reaction (2.5 U μl−1 MultiScribe 
Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Fisher), 1 μl deamination reaction,  
1.5 μM oligonucleotide, 100 μM dATP, 100 μM dCTP, 100 μM dTTP, and 
100 μM ddGTP). The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min and 
samples were analysed by denaturing 15% acrylamide gel electropho-
resis. The synthesized cDNA fragments were detected by fluorescence 
imaging with a C600 (Azure Biosystems).

Genome sequencing and SNP identification in bacteria
Overnight cultures from isolated colonies were used for total gDNA 
extraction with the DNeasy Blood & Tissue kit (Qiagen), and extraction 
yield was quantified using a Qubit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Sequenc-
ing libraries were constructed using the Nextera DNA Flex Library Prep 
Kit (Illumina). Library quality and concentration was evaluated with a 
Qubit and TapeStation System (Agilent). Sequencing was performed 
with an Illumina MiSeq instrument (300 cycles paired end program). 
Genome mapping was performed with BWA49 using the E. coli MG1655 
(NC_000913.3) genome as a reference. Pileup data from alignments 
were generated with SAMtools and variant calling was performed with 
VarScan250. SNPs were considered valid if they were present at a fre-
quency greater than 90%.

Mammalian cell culture
All cells were cultured and maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Anti-
biotics were not used for cell culture of HEK293T cells, U2OS cells, 
T-Rex-293-based POLGdn cells and primary fibroblasts. HEK293T cells 
(CRL-3216, American Type Culture Collection (ATCC)) were cultured in 
DMEM with GlutaMax (Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 
10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Gibco). U2OS cells (HTB-96, ATCC) were 
cultured in McCoy’s 5A medium with GlutaMax (Thermo Fisher Scien-
tific) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Gibco). HeLa 
cells (ATCC CCL-2) were cultured in high glucose DMEM (Gibco) with 
10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biological), and 100 U ml−1 penicillin 
(Sigma-Aldrich). Primary human fibroblasts (GM04541, Coriell) were 
cultured in DMEM with GlutaMAX supplemented with 20% (v/v) FBS 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific). T-Rex-293-based POLGdn cells31 were cul-
tured in DMEM with GlutaMax (Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented 
with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Gibco), 1 mM sodium pyruvate and  
50 μg ml−1 uridine (Sigma-Aldrich). Cell lines were authenticated by 
their respective suppliers and tested negative for mycoplasma.

HEK293T and T-Rex-293-based POLGdn mammalian cell 
lipofection
Cells were seeded on 48-well collagen-coated plates (Corning) at a den-
sity of 2 × 105 cells per ml (250 μl total per well), 18–24 h before lipofec-
tion. Lipofection was performed at a cell density of approximately 70%. 
For split DddAtox–Cas9 screening, cells were transfected with 375 ng  
of split DddAtox–dSpCas9 monomer expression plasmid, 375 ng of split 
DddAtox–SaKKH-Cas9(D10A) monomer expression plasmid, 125 ng of 
SpCas9 guide RNA (gRNA) expression plasmid and 125 ng of SaKKH 
gRNA plasmid. pUC19 was used as a filler DNA for monomer and 
no-gRNA control experiments to make up to 1,000 ng of total plasmid 
DNA. For DdCBE experiments, cells were transfected with 500 ng of 
each mitoTALE monomer to make up 1,000 ng of total plasmid DNA. 
Lipofectamine 2000 (1.5 μl, Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used per 
well. Cells were collected at the indicated time point.
For western blot analysis of DdCBEs expressed in mammalian cells, 
HEK293T cells were seeded on 6-well tissue culture-treated plates 
(Corning) at a density of 2 × 105 cells per ml (2 ml total per well), 18–24 h  
before lipofection. Cells were transfected with 4,000 ng of each 
mitoTALE monomer to make up 8,000 ng of total plasmid DNA. Lipo-
fectamine 2000 (12 μl; ThermoFisher Scientific) was used per well. 
Cells were collected at the indicated time point.

U2OS cell plasmid nucleofection
We combined 500 ng of Left DdCBE monomer and 500 ng of Right 
DdCBE monomer in a volume that did not exceed 2 μl. This combined 
plasmid mixture was nucleofected in a final volume of 22 μl per sample 
in a 16-well Nucleocuvette strip (Lonza). U2OS cells were nucleofected 
using the SE Cell Line 4D-Nucleofector X Kit (Lonza) with 30,000–
50,000 cells per sample (program DN-100), according to the manu-
facturer’s protocol.

Cas9 mRNA in vitro transcription
A DNA fragment containing a T7 promoter driving expression of 
polyadenylated Cas9 transcript was isolated from purified plasmid 
(5 μg) using SpeI-HF restriction digestion (New England Biolabs) and 
purified with the MinElute PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen). mRNA was 
transcribed using the HiScribe T7 ARCA mRNA Kit (NEB) and purified 
using MEGAclear Transcription Clean-up kit (Thermo Fisher) according 
to the manufacturer’s instructions and stored at −80 °C.

Human primary fibroblast nucleofection
Human primary fibroblasts were nucleofected as previously described51. 
In brief, 500 ng of in vitro-transcribed Left-DdCBE mRNA and 500 ng of 
in vitro-transcribed Right-DdCBE mRNA were combined in a volume 
that did not exceed 2 μl. This combined mRNA mixture was nucleo-
fected in a final volume of 22 μl per sample in a 16-well Nucleocuvette 
strip (Lonza). Human primary fibroblasts (GM04541, Coriell) were 
nucleofected using the P2 Primary Cell 4D-Nucleofector kit (Lonza) 
with 2.5 × 105 cells per sample (program DS-150), according to the manu-
facturer’s protocol. The medium was changed after 24 h of nucleofec-
tion and cultured for 5 days before collection for high-throughput 
sequencing.

Cell viability assays
Cell viability was measured every 3 to 6 days over an 18-day time 
course using the CellTiter-Glo 2.0 assay (Promega) according to the 
manufacturer’s protocol. Luminescence was measured in 96-well flat 
black-bottomed polystyrene microplates (Corning) using a M1000 Pro 
microplate reader (Tecan) with a 1-s integration time.

Genomic DNA isolation from mammalian cell culture
Medium was removed, and cells were washed once with 1× Dulbecco’s 
phosphate-buffered saline (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Genomic DNA 
extraction was performed by addition of 40 μl freshly prepared lysis 
buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.05% SDS, and proteinase K (20 μg ml−1;  
Thermo Fisher Scientific)) directly into the 48-well culture well. The 
extraction solution was incubated at 37 °C for 60 min and then 80 °C for 
20 min. The resulting genomic DNA was subjected to bead cleanup with 
AMPure DNAdvance beads according to the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions (Beckman Coulter A48705).
For DNA isolation and Sanger sequencing of ND4-edited cells, total 
DNA was extracted from cells with the use of DNeasy Blood & Tissue 
Kit (Qiagen). The ND4 gene fragment spanning the edited m.11922 site 
was amplified with the use of AccuPrime Taq DNA Polymerase System 
(Thermo Fisher). Primers used for the PCR are listed in Supplementary 
Table 13. PCR reaction products were purified by gel extraction with the 
use of QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen) and subjected to Sanger 
sequencing at Genwiz.

High-throughput DNA sequencing of genomic DNA samples
Genomic sites of interest were amplified from genomic DNA samples 
and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq as previously described with the 
following modifications52. Amplification primers containing Illumina 
forward and reverse adapters (Supplementary Table 13) were used for 
a first round of PCR (PCR 1) to amplify the genomic region of interest. 
In brief, 1 μl of purified genomic DNA was used as input into the first 
round of PCR (PCR1). For PCR1, DNA was amplified to the top of the 
linear range using Phusion Hot Start II High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific), according to the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions but with the addition of 0.5x SYBR Green Nucleic Acid Gel Stain 
(Lonza) in each 25-μl reaction. For all amplicons, the PCR1 protocol 
used was an initial heating step of 2 min at 98 °C followed by an opti-
mized number of amplification cycles (10 s at 98 °C, 20 s at 62 °C, 30 s 
at 72 °C). Quantitative PCR was performed to determine the optimal 
cycle number for each amplicon. The number of cycles needed to reach 

the top of the linear range of amplification are about 27–28 cycles for 
nuclear DNA amplicons and about 17–19 cycles for mtDNA amplicons. 
Barcoding PCR2 reactions (25 μl) were performed with 1 μl of unpuri-
fied PCR1 product and amplified with Q5 Hot Start MasterMix (NEB) 
using the following protocol: 98 °C for 2 min, then 9 cycles of (98 °C for  
10 s, 61 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 30 s), followed by a final 72 °C extension 
for 2 min. PCR products were evaluated analytically by electrophore-
sis in a 1.5% agarose gel. After PCR2, up to 300 samples with different 
barcode combinations were combined and purified by gel extraction 
using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen). DNA concentration 
was quantified using the Qubit ssDNA HS Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher 
Scientific) to make up a 4 nM library. The library concentration was 
further verified by qPCR (KAPA Library Quantification Kit-Illumina, 
Kapa Biosystems) and sequenced using an Illumina MiSeq with 210- to 
300-bp single-end reads.

Analysis of high-throughput sequencing data for DNA 
sequencing and targeted amplicon sequencing
Sequencing reads were demultiplexed using MiSeq Reporter (Illumina). 
Batch analysis with CRISPResso253 was used for targeted amplicon and 
DNA sequencing analysis. A 10-bp window was used to quantify indels 
centred around the middle of the dsDNA spacing. To set the cleavage 
offset, a hypothetical 15-or 16-bp spacing region has a cleavage offset 
of −8. Otherwise, the default parameters were used for analysis. The 
output file “Reference.NUCLEOTIDE_PERCENTAGE_SUMMARY.txt” was 
imported into Microsoft Excel for quantification of editing frequen-
cies. Reads containing indels within the 10-bp window are excluded for 
calculation of editing frequencies. The output file “CRISPRessoBatch_
quantification_of_editing_frequency.txt” was imported into Microsoft 
Excel for quantification of indel frequencies. Indel frequencies were 
computed by dividing the sum of insertions and deletions over the 
total number of aligned reads.

Determination of relative total mitochondrial DNA levels by 
quantitative PCR
Quantitative PCR (qPCR) reactions were performed on a Bio-Rad 
CFX96/C1000 qPCR machine performed using SYBR green (Lonza). 
For Extended Data Fig. 6i, 5 ng of purified DNA was used as template 
input in a 25-μl reaction volume. For Extended Data Fig. 8a, 8 ng of 
purified DNA was used as template input in a 25-μl reaction volume. 
For all reactions, the protocol used was an initial heating step of 
2 min at 98 °C followed by 40 cycles of amplification (10 s at 98 °C, 
20 s at 62 °C, 15 s at 72 °C). Single threshold values (∆C) were deter-
mined by manufacturer’s software. For Extended Data Fig. 6i, the 
level of mtDNA was determined by the calculating the ratio of total 
mtDNA to genomic DNA (β-actin) (Ratio = EmtDNA
Eβ-actin ∆C(DdCBE – dead DdCBE), where E is the efficiency of the qPCR reaction; 
END6 = 0.858, END5 = 0.844, EATP8 = 0.995, Eβ-actin = 1.05). For the assessment 
of mtDNA level in Extended Data Fig. 8a, 8 ng of isolated DNA was used 
in qPCR reaction performed with the use of iQ SYBR Green Supermix 
(Bio-Rad). Relative abundance of the amplified ND1 gene fragment  
was normalized to the amplified B2M gene fragment. See Supplemen-
tary Table 13 for list of primers used. NC_012920 was used as the ref-
erence for mtDNA; NG_003019 was used as the reference for human 
ACTBP2.

∆C(DdCBE – dead DdCBE)/ 

RNA isolation and RT-qPCR
Total RNA was extracted from cells with the use of RNeasy Mini Kit 
(Qiagen) and digested with DNase I (Qiagen). Isolated RNA (500 ng) was 
used for reverse transcription performed with the use of SuperScript 
III First-Strand Synthesis SuperMix for qRT–PCR (Thermo Fisher). The 
obtained cDNA was used for qPCR. Analysis of mitochondrial gene 
expression was performed with the use of iQ SYBR Green Supermix 
(BioRad) using primers listed in Supplementary Table 13. Data was 
normalized to B2M abundance.

Oxygen consumption analysis by Seahorse XF analyser
Seahorse plate was coated with 0.01% (w/v) poly-l-lysine (Sigma). Cells 
(1.6 × 104) were seeded on the coated Seahorse plate 16 h before the anal-
ysis in the Seahorse XFe96 Analyzer (Agilent). Analysis was performed 
in the Seahorse XF DMEM Medium pH 7.4 (Agilent) supplemented with 
10 mM glucose (Agilent), 2 mM l-glutamine (Gibco) and 1 mM sodium 
pyruvate (Gibco). Mito stress protocol was applied with the use of  
1.5 mM oligomycin, 1 mM FCCP and 1 mM piericidin + 1 mM antimycin.

Complex I and IV activity assay
Complex I activity assay was performed with the use of colorimetric 
Complex I Enzyme Activity Microplate Assay Kit (Abcam) according to 
the manufacturer’s protocol. Complex IV activity assay was performed 
with the use of colorimetric Complex IV Human Enzyme Activity Micro-
plate Assay Kit (Abcam) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. In 
brief, cells were collected and washed twice with PBS (Gibco) followed 
by protein extraction and incubation of clarified cell lysates at concen-
tration of 0.25 mg ml−1 on the microplates for 3 h at room temperature. 
Complex I activity was determined by measurement of absorbance at 
OD = 450 nm, which is increased by reduction of a dye simultaneous 
to NADH to NAD+ oxidation. Complex IV activity was determined by 
measurement of absorbance at OD = 550 nm, which decreases follow-
ing oxidation of reduced cytochrome c.

Long-range PCR to detect mtDNA deletions
Long-range PCR was performed on purified genomic DNA as previously 
with listed primers (Supplementary Table 13) to capture the whole 
mtDNA genome as two overlapping fragment of around 8 kb each. In 
brief, around 50–200 ng of purified DNA was used as input for amplifi-
cation by PRIMESTAR GXL DNA polymerase (Takara). For all reactions, 
the protocol used was an initial heating step of 1 min at 94 °C followed 
by 30 cycles of amplification (30 s at 98 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, 9 min at 72 °C). 
Unpurified PCR products were run on 0.8% agarose gel and stained 
with ethidium bromide.

Immunocytochemical studies of DdCBE localization
HeLa cells were transfected with a total of 1 ug of plasmid DNA (500 ng 
for each monomer) to express left (HA-tagged) or right (Flag-tagged) 
monomers of each DdCBE using Lipofectamine 3000 (Thermo Fisher) 
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. After 24 h incubation, cells 
were labelled with MitoTracker Deep Red (Thermo Fisher) at a final 
concentration of 100 nM for 30 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator. Cells 
were then seeded on an 8-well chamber glass slide (Ibidi) and fixed in 
4% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 15 min at room temperature. Next, cells 
were washed twice with PBS and permeabilized in PBS containing 0.1% 
saponin and 1% BSA for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were then 
immunostained with anti-HA (Biolegend) or anti-Flag (Sigma Aldrich), 
followed by Alexa-Fluor conjugated anti-mouse (HA tag) or anti-rabbit 
(Flag tag) secondary antibodies (Thermo Fisher). Images were taken 
using a 60× objective with the high-resolution widefield Nikon system. 
Acquired images were processed in Fiji48.

Bulk ATAC–seq for whole mitochondrial genome sequencing
Assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing (ATAC–
seq) was performed as previously described54. In brief, 5,000–10,000 
cells were trypsinzed, washed with cold 1X PBS, pelleted by centrifuga-
tion (500g at 4 °C for 5 min) and lysed in 50 μl of cold and freshly pre-
pared lysis buffer (0.1% Igepal CA-360 (v/v %), 10 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM 
NaCl and 3 mM MgCl2 in nuclease-free water). Lysates were incubated 
on ice for 3 min, pelleted at 500g for 10 min at 4 °C and tagmented with 
2.5 μl of Tn5 transposase (Illumina, 15027865) in a total volume of 10 μl 
containing 1x TD buffer (Illumina, 15027866),0.1% NP-40 (Sigma) and 
0.3x PBS. Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min on a thermomixer 
at 300 rpm. DNA was purified using the MinElute PCR Kit (Qiagen) 

and eluted in 10 μl elution buffer. All 10 μl of the eluate was amplified 
using indexed primers (1.25 μM each) listed in Supplementary Table 13 
and NEBNext High-Fidelity 2X PCR Master Mix (NEB) in a total volume 
of 50 μl using the following protocol: 72 °C for 5 min, 98 °C for 30 s, 
then 5 cycles of (98 °C for 10 s, 63 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 60 s), fol-
lowed by a final 72 °C extension for 1 min. After the initial 5 cycles of 
pre-amplification, 5 μl of partially amplified library was used as input 
DNA in a total volume of 15 μl for quantitative PCR using SYBR Green 
(0.5x, Lonza) to determine the number of additional cycles needed to 
reach 1/3 of the maximum fluorescence intensity. Typically, 3–8 cycles 
were conducted on the remaining 45 μl of partially amplified library. 
The final library was purified using a MinElute PCR kit (Qiagen) and 
quantified using a Qubit dsDNA HS Assay kit (Invitrogen) and a High 
Sensitivity DNA chip run on a Bioanalyzer 2100 system (Agilent). All 
libraries were sequenced using Nextseq High Output Cartridge kits on 
an Illumina Nextseq 500 sequencer. Libraries were sequenced using 
paired-end 2×75 cycles and demultiplexed using the bcl2fastq program.

Targeted amplicon sequencing for nuclear DNA off-target 
analyses
Genomic DNA was isolated and purified as described in the section 
“Genomic DNA isolation from mammalian cell culture”. The on-target 
mtDNA binding sites for ND6-, ND5.1- and ND4-DdCBE were aligned to 
the NCBI reference sequence for human chromosome 5 (NC_000005.10) 
to identify MTND6P4, MTND5P11 and MTND4P12. These pseudogenes 
are regions in the nuclear DNA that contain the greatest homology to 
their respective DdCBE binding sites in mtDNA. Samples were pre-
pared for high-throughput sequencing as described in the section 
“High-throughput DNA sequencing of genomic DNA samples”. The 
following primers were used for appending sequencing adapters to 
MTND6P4: MTND6P4 forward: ACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCC 
GATCTNNNNGTTGTAGCCCGTGCAAGAATAATG; MTND6P4 reverse: 
TGGAGTTCAGACGTGTGCTCTTCCGATCTTAACACTAATCCTACTTCC 
ATC. For MTND5P11 and MTND4P12, a 5 kb region was amplified with 
primer set 1 (Forward 1 and Forward 2) to ensure selective ampli-
fication of nuclear DNA rather than mtDNA. The 5-kb fragment was 
purified using MinElute PCR Kit (Qiagen) and used as the DNA input 
for subsequent amplification steps using the indicated sequencing 
adaptor primers: Forward 1: CTAATTCTCTTTGAGGAGCATGGTTAG; 
Forward 2: TATCACTTCCAGCCACCTATTTCC; MTND5P11 forward:

Genome sequencing and SNP identification in mitochondria
SNP identification in mitochondria was performed similarly to in bac-
teria, with the following modifications. Genome mapping was per-
formed with BWA (v.0.7.17) using NC_012920 genome as a reference. 
Duplicates were marked using Picard tools (v.2.20.7). Pileup data from 
alignments were generated with SAMtools (v.1.9) and variant calling 
was performed with VarScan2 (v.2.4.3). Variants that were present at a 
frequency greater than 0.1% and a P value less than 0.05 (Fisher’s exact 
test) were called as high-confidence SNPs independently in each bio-
logical replicate. Only reads with a Phred quality score (Q) of greater 
than 30 at a given position were taken into account when calling SNPs 
at that particular position.

Calculation of average off-target C•G-to-T•A editing frequency
To calculate the mitochondrial genome-wide average off-target edit-
ing frequency for each DdCBE in Fig. 5b, we used REDItools (v.1.2.1)55. 
All nucleobases except cytosines and guanines were removed and the 
number of reads covering each C•G base pair with a Phred quality score 

greater than 30 (Q > 30) was calculated. The on-target C•G base pairs 
(depending on the DdCBE used in each treatment) were excluded in 
order to consider only off-target effects. C•G-to-T•A SNVs present at 
high frequencies (greater than 50%) in both treated and untreated 
samples (that therefore did not arise from DdCBE treatment) were also 
excluded. The average off-target editing frequency was then calculated 
independently for each biological replicate of each treatment condition 
as: (number of reads in which a given C•G base pair was called as a T•A 
base pair, summed over all non-target C•G base pairs)/(total number 
of reads that covered all non-target C•G base pair). Sequence logos 
in Fig. 5c, depicting the local sequence context of all off-target SNVs, 
were generated as described previously56. For Supplementary Tables 8 
and 9, the average frequency of each SNV was calculated by taking the 
average of three frequencies from the biological triplicates.

Effect prediction of the C•G-to-T•A off-target SNVs identified by 
ATAC–seq
SIFT57 (https://sift.bii.a-star.edu.sg /) was used to predict the out-
come of nonsynonymous mutations on protein function. High- and 
low-confidence calls were made using standard SIFT parameters with 
GRCh37.74 database as the reference genome.

Extended Data Fig. 4 | TALE–split DddAtox proteins mediate ef f icient base 
editing in nuclear DNA of U2OS cells. a, Left–G1333-DddAtox-N and R ight–
G1333-DddAtox-C bind DNA sequences within CCR5. Target cytosines are shown 
in purple and TALE binding sites are shown in blue. Two copies of UGI proteins 
(2×-UGI) were fused to the N- or C terminus through a 2- or 16-amino acid linker. 
Editing eff iciencies and indel frequencies for the possible combinations of UGI 
positions and linker lengths are shown. In the absence of UGI protein, only 
C9-to-T9 edit was observed. b, Architecture of nuclear-targeting CCR5-DdCBE 

(see Fig. 3c for optimized DdCBE architecture targeting mtDNA). Target 
cytosines are shown in purple. c, Editing eff iciencies and indel frequencies of 
cells treated with CCR5-DdCBE and ND6-DdCBE 3-days-post transfection are 
shown. Dead-DdCBEs containing the inactive DddAtox(E1347A) mutant were 
used as negative controls. d, Outcomes among edited alleles in which the 
specif ied target C is mutated are shown for the indicated base editor. Values 
and error bars in a, c and d ref lect the mean ± s.d. of n = 3 independent 
biological replicates.

mediate modest editing of mitochondrial ND6 in HEK293T cells.  
a, Architectures of non-UGI containing ND6-mitoTALE–DddAtox fusion pair. 
DddAtox was split at G1333 or G1397, with each half fused to either the left TALE 
or the right TALE . TALEs bind to mtDNA sequences (blue) that f lank a 15-bp 

spacing region in mitochondrial ND6 . Target cytosines are shown in purple. 
The last TALE repeat (*) did not match the reference genome9 (see 
Supplementary Table 4). b, mtDNA editing eff iciencies of mitoTALE–DddAtox 
pairs in the listed split orientations. The dashed line is drawn at 0.1% . Values and 
error bars ref lect the mean ± s.d. of n = 3 independent biological replicates.

ATP8-DdCBE (d) and BE2max and BE4max (e) are shown for each time point. 
C•G-to-T•A conversions at protein-coding genes that generate missense 
mutations (green) of the putative amino acid (red) are shown. f, Western blots 
of ND6 -, ND5 .1-, ND5 . 2- and ATP8-DdCBE at various time points. The right halves 
were Flag-tagged and the left halves were HA-tagged. Day 3 images are 
representative of n = 3 independent biological replicates; n = 1 for day 6 and day 
12 images (see Supplementary Data 3 for uncropped images and f luorescent 

tagging of each half ). Nuclear β-actin was used as a loading control. g, Cell 
viability was measured by recording the luminescence at the indicated time 
points. Luminescence values were normalized to the untreated control. h, DNA 
gel of PCR-amplif ied mtDNA captured as two amplicons (red). Images are 
representative of n = 3 independent biological replicates (see Supplementary 
Data 4 for uncropped images). i, mtDNA levels of DdCBE-edited cells were 
measured by qPCR relative to untreated cells. Values and error bars in a–e, g 
and i ref lect the mean ± s.d. of n = 3 independent biological replicates. For a–e, 
asterisks indicate signif icant editing based on a comparison between indicated 
time points. *P < 0.05 and **P < 0.01 by Student ’s two-tailed paired t-test.

Data collection

High-throughput sequencing data was collected on Illumina Miseq and Nextseq instruments. 

Data analysis

High-throughput sequencing data was analyzed using CRISPResso2 Sequencing reads were demultiplexed using the MiSeq Reporter 
(Illumina) and fastq files were analyzed using Crispresso2. Prism 8 (GraphPad) was used to generate dot plots and bar plots of these data.  
For mitochondrial genome analysis, Genome mapping was performed with BWA (v0.7.17) using NC_012920 genome as a reference. 
Duplicates were marked using Picard tools (v2.20.7). Pileup data from alignments were generated with SAMtools (v1.9) and variant 
calling was performed with VarScan2 (v2.4.3). Variants that were present at a frequency greater than 0.1% and a p-value less than 0.05 
(Fisher’s Exact Test) were called as high-confidence SNPs independently in each biological replicate. Only reads with Q > 30 at a given 
position were taken into account when calling SNPs at that particular position. Further details and references and provided in the 
Methods. For the generation of sequence logos, flanking sequences were aligned, fixing the mutant cytosine in each case at position 21, 
and the resulting alignment was used to produce a sequence logo using WebLogo 3.6.0. Further details and references are provided in 
the Methods.

Bacterial toxins represent a vast reservoir of biochemical diversity that can be 
repurposed for biomedical applications. Such proteins include a group of predicted 
interbacterial toxins of the deaminase superfamily, members of which have found 
application in gene-editing techniques1,2. Because previously described cytidine 
deaminases operate on single-stranded nucleic acids3, their use in base editing 
requires the unwinding of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA)—for example by a CRISPR–
Cas9 system. Base editing within mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), however, has thus far 
been hindered by challenges associated with the delivery of guide RNA into the 
mitochondria4. As a consequence, manipulation of mtDNA to date has been limited to 
the targeted destruction of the mitochondrial genome by designer nucleases9,10.Here 
we describe an interbacterial toxin, which we name DddA, that catalyses the 
deamination of cytidines within dsDNA. We engineered split-DddA halves that are 
non-toxic and inactive until brought together on target DNA by adjacently bound 
programmable DNA-binding proteins. Fusions of the split-DddA halves, transcription 
activator-like effector array proteins, and a uracil glycosylase inhibitor resulted in 
RNA-free DddA-derived cytosine base editors (DdCBEs) that catalyse C•G-to-T•A 
conversions in human mtDNA with high target specificity and product purity. We used 
DdCBEs to model a disease-associated mtDNA mutation in human cells, resulting in 
changes in respiration rates and oxidative phosphorylation. CRISPR-free DdCBEs 
enable the precise manipulation of mtDNA, rather than the elimination of mtDNA 
copies that results from its cleavage by targeted nucleases, with broad implications 
for the study and potential treatment of mitochondrial disorders.

Inherited or acquired mutations in mtDNA are associated with a range 
of human diseases5,6. Tools for introducing specific modifications into 
mtDNA are urgently needed both to model and to potentially treat 
these diseases. The development of such tools, however, has been 
hindered by the challenge of transporting RNAs into mitochondria, 
including guide RNAs that are required to program CRISPR-associated 
proteins4.
Each mammalian cell contains many copies of a circular mtDNA that 
can exist in a heteroplasmic mixture of wild-type and mutant alleles7. 
Current approaches to manipulate mtDNA rely on RNA-free program-
mable nucleases, such as transcription activator-like effector nucleases 
(TALENs)8,9 and zinc finger nucleases10, fused to mitochondrial target-
ing signal (MTS) sequences to induce double-strand breaks in mtDNA. 
Linearized mtDNA is rapidly degraded11,12, resulting in heteroplasmic 
shifts to favour uncut mtDNA genomes. As a candidate therapeutic 
or disease-modelling tool, this approach cannot introduce specific 

nucleotide changes in mtDNA, and cannot be applied to homoplasmic 
mtDNA mutations because destroying all mtDNA copies is presumed 
to be harmful7,11.
An alternative to the targeted destruction of mtDNA through 
double-strand breaks is precision genome editing, a capability that—
to the best of our knowledge—has not been previously reported for 
mtDNA. The ability to precisely install or correct pathogenic mutations 
could accelerate the modelling of diseases caused by mtDNA mutations, 
facilitate preclinical drug candidate testing, and potentially enable 
therapeutic approaches that directly correct pathogenic mtDNA muta-
tions. Although cytidine and adenosine deaminases are important for 
precision genome editing by enabling base editing in the nucleus1,2,13,14, 
their biochemical and functional diversity remain largely unexplored. 
Bacterial genomes contain various uncharacterized deaminases15, rais-
ing the possibility that some may possess unique activities that enable 
new genome-editing capabilities.

An interbacterial deaminase-like toxin

Some predicted bacterial deaminases contain sequences that suggest 
them to be substrates for intercellular protein delivery systems, such as 
the type VI secretion system (T6SS)15. This system mediates antagonism 
between Gram-negative bacteria by transferring antibacterial toxins 
into contacting cells16,17. Given their sequence divergence from char-
acterized deaminases, we sought to define the biochemical activity of 
T6SS-associated deaminases. We focused on a predicted deaminase 
belonging to the SCP1.201-like family15, henceforth referred to as DddA, 
encoded by Burkholderia cenocepacia (Fig. 1a). A B. cenocepacia strain 
lacking dddA and the downstream predicted immunity gene (dddIA) 
exhibited a marked growth defect when co-cultivated with the wild-type 
strain (Fig. 1b, Extended Data Fig. 1a, b). This defect was not observed 
in co-culture with a strain that lacked the activity of a T6SS (∆icmF1) or 
with a strain that expressed DddA containing an amino acid substitution 
of a predicted catalytic residue (dddAE1347A) . These data establish DddA 
as an antibacterial toxin that is delivered by the T6SS.
Members of the deaminase superfamily are known to catalyse the 
deamination of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), RNA, free nucleosides, 
nucleotides, nucleobases and other nucleotide derivatives15. To define the 
substrate of DddA, which belongs to a clade of predicted deaminases that 
lack a characterized member15, we first determined whether deaminases 
that represent the substrate range of the superfamily are toxic if expressed 
in bacteria. The growth of Escherichia coli was unaffected by the production 
of deaminases that act on ssDNA, tRNA or free cytidine (Fig. 1c, Extended 
Data Fig. 1c). By contrast, DddA markedly reduced the viability of E. coli 
(Fig. 1c). We identified amino acids 1264–1427 of DddA as the domain that 
confers toxicity, referred to henceforth as DddAtox (see Methods for details 
of the identification of the toxin domain). These findings suggested that 
DddA may act on a previously undescribed deaminase substrate.

DddA is a double-stranded DNA deaminase

To further clarify the substrate and mechanism of DddAtox, we deter-
mined a co-crystal structure of DddAtox bound to the immunity protein 
DddIA at 2.5 Å resolution (Supplementary Table 1). DddAtox adopts a 
typical deaminase fold consisting of a five-stranded β-sheet with but-
tressing helices that contribute catalytic residues (Fig. 1d). DddIA con-
tains a central β-sheet that occludes the active site of DddAtox (Fig. 1d). 
Structure-based homology searches revealed APOBEC enzymes as the 
closest structural relatives of DddAtox, with divergence at the C-terminal 
β-strands; these strands are antiparallel with an extended intervening 
loop in DddAtox, whereas they are parallel with an intervening α-helix 
in APOBEC enzymes (Fig. 1d, e).
So far, all reported DNA cytidine deaminases operate predominantly on 
ssDNA, often with a preference for the base immediately 5′ of the substrate 
C3. We measured the in vitro activity of DddAtox on a ssDNA substrate con-
taining cytosine in all four possible 5′-NC contexts. Whereas the activity of 
APOBEC3A was readily detected, DddAtox did not catalyse uracil formation 
within ssDNA sequences (Fig. 1f ). As a control, we included a related dsDNA 
substrate. Consistent with previous studies18, APOBEC3A did not display 
measurable activity against dsDNA. Unexpectedly, however, DddAtox 
efficiently converted cytosine to uracil within dsDNA (Fig. 1g, Extended 
Data Fig. 1d). The catalytically inactive enzyme, DddAtox(E1347A), showed 
no uracil formation, indicating that deamination was dependent on the 
activity of DddAtox. We did not detect deamination of single-stranded or 
double-stranded RNA substrates by DddAtox (Extended Data Fig. 1e, f ). 
These results collectively establish DddAtox as a cytidine deaminase that 
operates preferentially on dsDNA; the enzyme was therefore named 
‘double-stranded DNA deaminase toxin A’, or DddA.
If DddAtox converts cytosine to uracil specifically within dsDNA, the 
enzyme should be mutagenic in a manner that is dependent on uracil

DNA glycosylase (UDG), which initiates base excision repair through 
uracil removal19. Indeed, expression of sub-lethal levels of DddAtox in  
E. coli substantially increased the mutation frequency, and these 
mutagenic effects of DddAtox were enhanced more than 100-fold in an  
E. coli strain lacking UDG (Fig. 1h). We next used the high mutation rate 
caused by sub-lethal DddAtox levels to profile the sequence context 
preference of the enzyme. We performed whole-genome sequencing 
on five E. coli lineages that experienced serial DddAtox exposure and 
clonal bottlenecking, and five control strains that underwent a simi-
lar regimen in the presence of DddAtox(E1347A). Consistent with our 
mutation-frequency measurements, we observed approximately 50-fold 
more total single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in strains exposed 
to active DddAtox (997) than in strains producing the inactive enzyme 
(17), and more than 99% of the DddAtox-dependent SNPs were C•G-to-T•A 
transitions (Extended Data Fig. 2a–c). The alignment of sequences flank-
ing the converted cytosine within these C•G-to-T•A mutations revealed 
a strong preference for 5′-TC contexts (Fig. 1i), matching the sequence 
preference of the enzyme in vitro (Extended Data Fig. 2d). Together, these 
findings reveal that DddAtox deaminates dsDNA substrates in vitro and 
in bacterial cells with a preference for 5′-TC contexts.

Splitting DddAtox into non-toxic halves

Current base editors deaminate nucleotides in ssDNA loops created by 
RNA-guided CRISPR proteins1,13,14. The ability of DddAtox to deaminate 
cytidines in dsDNA raises the possibility of using RNA-free program-
mable dsDNA-binding proteins, such as zinc-finger arrays20 or TALE 
repeat arrays21, to direct DddAtox to mtDNA targets without requiring 
CRISPR or guide RNAs.
As expected (Fig. 1b, c), the expression of intact DddAtox fused to 
programmable DNA-binding proteins was toxic to human HEK293T 

cells (Supplementary Discussion). To avoid this toxicity, we proposed 
splitting the protein into two inactive halves, one containing the N ter-
minus of DddAtox (DddAtox-N) and the other containing the C terminus 
(DddAtox-C). These halves would reconstitute deamination activity only 
when assembled adjacently on target DNA, analogous to the assembly 
of FokI monomers to reconstitute dsDNA nuclease activity in zinc finger 
nucleases20 and TALENs21.
On the basis of the DddAtox–DddIA co-crystal structure, we split DddAtox 
into DddAtox-N and DddAtox-C halves at seven sites within loops (Fig. 2a), 
naming each split to reflect the last residue of DddAtox-N. Screening of 
split sites was performed with CRISPR–Cas9 proteins to facilitate testing 
of split DddAtox variants directed to target DNA half-sites with different 
spacing region lengths22 (Supplementary Table 2). Each DddAtox half was 
fused to the N terminus of dSpCas923 or an orthogonal Staphylococcus 
aureus Cas9 variant (SaKKH-Cas9)24. Each split was assayed in its two 
possible fusion orientations: SaKKH-Cas9 fused either to DddAtox-N 
(‘aureus-N’) or to DddAtox-C (‘aureus-C’) (Fig. 2b, c). The top DNA strand 
of test sites contained more TC motifs than the bottom strand and was 
therefore more likely to be edited by DddAtox (Extended Data Fig. 3). To 
enhance edits at target sites, we used SaKKH-Cas9(D10A) nickase25to 
nick the bottom strand, in order to promote its resynthesis using the 
edited top DNA strand as a template13,14,26,27.
Among active split-DddAtox–Cas9 fusions, we observed C•G-to-T•A 
conversions in the spacing region between the two protospacers 
(Fig. 2d, Extended Data Fig. 3). All editing efficiencies in this study 
report the fraction of sequenced alleles with the desired C•G-to-T•A 
edit among all treated cells with no enrichment. Notably, we observed 
no on-target editing in the absence of guide RNAs or when only one 
DddAtox–Cas9 half and its guide RNA were present (Supplementary 
Table 3), indicating that editing is strictly dependent on the reassembly 
of both DddAtox halves at the Cas9-specified target site.

Among the seven splits tested, splits at G1333 and G1397 yielded 
the highest editing efficiencies of 22%–48% at the most highly edited 
position within the target spacing region (Extended Data Fig. 3b, g, h, 
Supplementary Discussion). For a given fusion orientation, the editing 
efficiencies of target bases were dependent on their positions within 
the spacing region; for example, G1397 aureus-C yielded 20%–22% edit-
ing at a target TC14 (the 14th nucleotide of the spacing region between 
the two target protospacers) within 17- and 23-bp spacing regions, and 
41% within a 44-bp spacing region (Fig. 2d). These results collectively 
suggest that splitting DddAtox at G1333 and G1397 produces halves 
that reconstitute at a target site to mediate C•G-to-T•A conversion 
in human cells. Spacing region length, target cytosine position and 
split orientation are all determinants of the base-editing efficiency 
of split-DddAtox.

Nuclear base editing by TALE–DddAtox

Because DddAtox split at G1333 or G1397 can deaminate target TCs within 
a modest spacing region (Supplementary Discussion), we speculated 
that fusing split DddAtox halves to TALE array proteins that bind neigh-
bouring DNA sites might result in CRISPR-free, RNA-free base editing 
in human cells.

We fused DddAtox halves split at G1333 to TALE array proteins con-
taining a bipartite nuclear localization signal (bpNLS) to bind nuclear 
DNA sequences flanking an 18-bp spacing region within CCR5 in U2OS 
cells (Extended Data Fig. 4a). Compared with simple fusions that do not 
contain a uracil glycosylase inhibitor (UGI), appending two copies of 
UGI (2×-UGI)14,28 to the N terminus increased the editing efficiency at C9 
by approximately 8-fold (to 22%–27%) and reduced indels to less than 
2.3 ± 0.31% (mean ± s.d.). Fusing 2×-UGI to the C terminus through a 2- or 
a 16-amino-acid linker resulted in lower editing efficiencies of 12 ± 3.5% or 
3.3 ± 1.3%, respectively (Extended Data Fig. 4a). These results collectively 
demonstrate that split DddAtox can be fused to TALE arrays to mediate 
C•G-to-T•A conversions in human nuclear DNA, and that fusing UGI to these 
proteins enhances editing efficiencies and reduces indel byproducts14,28.

Mitochondrial base editing by TALE–DddAtox

To apply TALE–split DddAtox fusions for mitochondrial base editing, 
we fused split DddAtox halves to MTS-linked TALE proteins that target 
MT-ND69, a mitochondrial gene that encodes the NADH dehydroge-
nase 6 subunit of complex I (Supplementary Table 4). Among fusions 
that did not contain UGI, we observed the highest level of mtDNA 
target editing (4.9 ± 0.17%) for the architecture that comprised the

C-terminal half of DddAtox split at G1397 and bound to the right TALE 
assembled with the N-terminal half of DddAtox split at G1397 and 
bound to the left TALE (Right–G1397-C + Left–G1397-N; Extended Data  
Fig. 5a, b).
In contrast to nuclear-localized TALE–DddAtox, fusing one or two 
UGI proteins to the N terminus of each mitoTALE–DddAtox half did not 
enhance C•G-to-T•A conversion. Appending one UGI to the C terminus, 
however, increased editing levels by three- to tenfold compared with con-
structs that lacked UGI (up to 16%–27% for C6, C7 and C13 in TC contexts). 
Adding a second copy of UGI to the C terminus did not further increase 
mtDNA editing efficiencies (Fig. 3a). UGI probably inhibits mitochon-
drial UNG1 to enhance editing efficiencies by impeding uracil excision29. 
Removing the MTS sequences or replacing them with a bpNLS was found 
to abrogate editing, demonstrating that MT-ND6 editing is dependent on 
the mitochondrial localization of the mitoTALE–DddAtox fusions (Fig. 3a).
Fluorescence microscopy images revealed that, whereas MTS–
mitoTALE–split-DddAtox–UGI fusions localized to the mitochondria 
in HeLa cells, MTS–UGI–mitoTALE–split-DddAtox fusions remained 
diffused throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 3b). These findings explain 
the observed dependence of editing efficiency on the position of 
UGI fusion and suggest that proximity between the MTS and an 
N-terminal UGI may impede mitochondrial import of the fusion  
protein.
These results collectively suggested the following optimized mito-
TALE–split-DddAtox architecture (in N- to C-terminus order): an MTS, a 

TALE array, a two-amino-acid linker, a DddAtox half from the G1333 or G1397 
split, and one UGI protein (Fig. 3c). This architecture, hereafter referred 
to as DddA-derived cytosine base editor (DdCBE), represents—to our 
knowledge—the first agent that is capable of performing precise genome 
editing in mtDNA. The application of DdCBE contrasts with previously 
reported uses of nucleases to make double-strand breaks in mtDNA, which 
result in the loss of targeted mtDNA copies and in heteroplasmic shifts8–10.
Given that DddAtox can edit cytosines on either DNA strand, inter-
mediates that contain uracils on opposing DNA strands could produce 
double-strand breaks during DNA repair, causing unwanted indels. 
Although the standard cytosine base editor BE4max30—when targeted 
to EMX1 in the nucleus—resulted in 1.8 ± 0.67% indels in HEK293T cells, 
indels were not detected (less than 0.1%) at MT-ND6 despite DdCBE edit-
ing both mtDNA strands (Fig. 3c, Extended Data Fig. 4b, c). Indeed, we 
observed very high product purities (at least 99.5%) for DdCBE-mediated 
mtDNA base editing of MT-ND6 in HEK293T cells and in U2OS cells—
exceeding the product purities resulting from the editing of CCR5 by 
nuclear-targeted BE4max (96 ± 0.78%) and by nuclear-targeted DdCBE 
(95 ± 0.52%) (Fig. 3d, Extended Data Fig. 4d). These results suggest that 
the DNA repair processes that lead to indels and other byproducts in 
nuclear DNA19 are inefficient in mitochondria (Supplementary Discus-
sion; see Fig. 3e for MT-ND6 allele frequencies in HEK293T cells after 
treatment with MT-ND6-DdCBE, denoted as ND6-DdCBE). Instead, 
lesion-containing mtDNA is degraded rather than repaired11, resulting 
in the selective maintenance of cleanly edited mtDNA copies.

These findings establish a precision mtDNA editing platform, which 
uses a dsDNA-specific cytidine deaminase that is split to mitigate toxicity, 
programmable dsDNA-binding TALE arrays localized to the mitochon-
dria, and a UGI to achieve RNA-free base editing in the mitochondria.

Base editing of five mtDNA genes

To explore the generality of DdCBE for mtDNA editing, we engineered or 
adapted seven pairs of TALE arrays (Supplementary Table 4) to target five 
mitochondrial genes: MT-ND1, MT-ND2, MT-ND4, MT-ND5 and MT-ATP8.
Three to six days after treatment, mitochondrial base-editing effi-
ciencies of DdCBEs in HEK293T cells varied between 4.6% and 49% 
depending on the split type, split orientation and target cytosine posi-
tion within the spacing region. For DdCBEs using the G1333 split, the 
Right–G1333-C + Left–G1333-N orientation resulted in 2.1- to 15-fold 
higher editing efficiencies than the Right–G1333-N + Left–G1333-C 
orientation, regardless of the spacing length and positions of TC tar-
get bases (Fig. 4a–e, g). By contrast, the effect of split orientation on 
editing efficiencies was more site-dependent for G1397 (Fig. 4b, d–f ).
Collectively, optimized G1397-split DdCBEs mediated average 
base-editing efficiencies of 42% at each of four well-edited mtDNA sites 
(Fig. 4a–c, e) and average efficiencies of 9.0% at two modestly edited 
sites (Fig. 4d, f ), whereas the most efficient G1333-split DdCBEs yielded 
43% average conversion at three sites (Fig. 4a–c) and 7.4% average effi-
ciencies at three other sites (Fig. 4d, e, g). We did not detect indels or 
base editing outside the spacing region (Supplementary Tables 5, 6).
Within 14–18-bp spacing regions, G1397-split DdCBE preferen-
tially edited TCs that were positioned approximately 4–7 nucleotides 
upstream of the 3′ end of the spacing region in either mtDNA strand. By

contrast, G1333-split DdCBE preferentially edited TCs that were posi-
tioned approximately 4–10 nucleotides from the 5′ end of the spacing 
region in either mtDNA strand (Fig. 4h). These results indicate that each 
split edits TCs with a preference for specific windows in the spacing 
region. For a given target sequence, we recommend testing G1397 and 
G1333 splits in both orientations, using spacing lengths and TALE-binding 
sites guided by the above principles (Supplementary Discussion).
We confirmed the durability of mtDNA edits in HEK293T cells over 18 
days (Extended Data Fig. 6a–d, Supplementary Discussion). In addition, 
mtDNA editing did not reduce cell viability, produced no large mtDNA 
deletions, and did not perturb mtDNA copy numbers (Extended Data 
Fig. 6g–i, Supplementary Discussion). We observed a substantial reduc-
tion in editing when mtDNA replication was blocked by induced expres-
sion of a dominant negative mitochondrial polymerase gamma mutant31 
(Extended Data Fig. 7). We speculate that during mtDNA replication, repli-
cative polymerases incorporate A opposite U to resolve the U•G intermedi-
ate into a T•A base pair. DdCBE-mediated mtDNA editing in non-dividing 
cells should be feasible because mtDNA replication proceeds even in 
post-mitotic cells32. Indeed, untransformed primary human fibroblasts 
also supported efficient mtDNA base editing (typically 30%–40%) (Fig. 4i) 
despite dividing much less frequently than HEK293T cells, indicating that 
the use of DdCBE is not limited to immortalized cell lines.
Given that mutations in mtDNA genes that encode complex I subunits 
are thought to be pathogenic in rare tumours of the thyroid and kidney6,33, 
we investigated the consequences of editing MT-ND4 in cells containing 
the m.11922G>A mutation (for the characterization of other edited sites, 
see Extended Data Fig. 8c–f and Supplementary Discussion). Compared 
with control cells treated with catalytically inactive DdCBE, cells treated 
with ND4-DdCBE had lower rates of oxidative phosphorylation (Fig. 4j) 
and decreased basal and uncoupled respiration rates (Fig. 4k)—consistent 
with the disruption of complex I. Mitochondrial DNA homeostasis and 
associated transcripts were unchanged (Extended Data Fig. 8a, b). Also 
consistent with a specific defect in complex I, the enzymatic activity and 
assembly of complex I—but not of complex IV—were markedly reduced 
in these cells (Fig. 4l, m). These results establish that precise DdCBE 
editing can be applied to study mitochondrial phenotypes arising from 
disease-associated mtDNA mutations.

Off-target editing by DdCBEs

To profile the off-target activity of DdCBE in the human mitochondrial 
genome, we transfected HEK293T cells with plasmids that constitutively 
expressed optimized DdCBE or the corresponding dead-DdCBE con-
trol in order to distinguish DdCBE-induced single-nucleotide variants 
(SNVs) from background heteroplasmy. To test for possible editing 
arising as a result of the spontaneous assembly of split DddAtox in the 
absence of TALE-directed DNA binding, cells were also transfected with 
plasmids expressing MTS–G1397 split–UGI, with no TALE array (Fig. 5a).
The average frequencies of mitochondrial genome-wide off-target 
C•G-to-T•A editing by MTND5P2-DdCBE (denoted as ND5.2-DdCBE), 
ND4-DdCBE and ATP8-DdCBE (0.030%–0.034%) were similar to those 
of the untreated and dead-DdCBE controls (0.024%–0.030%), whereas 
MTND5P1-DdCBE (denoted as ND5.1-DdCBE) had a 1.6-fold higher aver-
age off-target editing frequency (0.049%) compared with the untreated 
control (Fig. 5b). We attribute the unusually high average off-target 
editing frequency by ND6-DdCBE (0.13%) to the permissive mutant 
N-terminal domain (NTD) of TALE (Fig. 3a), which may increase the 
non-specific binding of TALE arrays. Off-target mutations from the 
spontaneous reassembly of TALE-free split DddAtox were not detected 
at greater levels than in untreated cells (Fig. 5b). Notably, we did not 
observe significant off-target editing at nuclear pseudogenes, even 
though they differ by only 1–2 bp from the mtDNA on-target sites 
(Extended Data Fig. 9).
DdCBEs with standard NTDs generally exhibited 150- to 860-fold 
higher on-target editing relative to off-target editing, with no strong 

correlation between on-target editing efficiencies and off-target activ-
ity (Supplementary Table 8). Because all of these standard DdCBEs 
exhibit similar protein expression levels (Extended Data Fig. 6f ) and 
share wild-type NTDs and deaminase domains but have different TALE 
repeats, we conclude that TALE domains influence off-target activity. 
Moreover, TALE–split DddA fusions must be positioned in close prox-
imity for both on-target and off-target editing (Extended Data Fig. 10).
To further investigate the nature of off-target edits (see Extended 
Data Fig. 11 for predicted effect of off-target SNVs on protein function), 
we searched the 20-bp regions flanking each off-target SNV for any 
sequence homology to the on-target TALE-binding sites. Although we 
noted a strong 5′-TC-3′ preference for ND6-DdCBE and ND5.1-DdCBE 
off-target edits that matches the sequence preference for free DddAtox 
in E. coli (Fig. 1i, Supplementary Discussion), we did not observe any 
consensus off-target sequences that closely resemble on-target TALE 
binding sites (Fig. 5c). In addition, up to 20%–80% of SNVs identified 
for each DdCBE overlapped with those of other DdCBEs containing 
distinct TALE arrays programmed to bind different on-target sites 
(Supplementary Data 2, Supplementary Table 9). Collectively, these 
results suggest that off-target editing does not arise from editing at 
sequences similar to on-target sites. Instead, we speculate that DdCBE 
halves containing TALE arrays with greater non-specific DNA binding 
activity34 are more likely to bind proximally to transiently reassemble 
active DddAtox, which can then engage off-target mtDNA regions with 
no necessary homology to the on-target site.

Discussion

This study describes an interbacterial cytidine deaminase toxin specific for 
dsDNA, and its development into a CRISPR-free, RNA-free base editor that 
can install targeted mutations in the human mitochondrial genome with 
typical efficiencies ranging between 5% and 50%. The resulting DdCBEs 
enable programmable C•G-to-T•A conversions in mtDNA without requiring 
double-strand breaks, a capability that has the potential to model mito-
chondrial disease mutations, correct pathogenic variants (Supplementary 
Table 10) and expand our knowledge of mitochondrial biology.
Additional research will be needed to fully elucidate the principles 
that govern the efficiency and specificity of DdCBE. Developing in vitro 
and in vivo strategies to deliver DdCBEs will be essential for exploring 
their therapeutic potential in other cell types and in animal models 
of mitochondrial diseases. Exploring additional sources of natural 
diversity among bacterial DNA deaminases, or engineering DddA-
tox variants with altered sequence context and substrate preferences 
beyond 5′-TC-3′, would further expand the scope of mtDNA editing. 
Finally, although this study has focused on the use of DdCBE for mito-
chondrial base editing, some features of DdCBE (or zinc-finger array 
variants35)—such as its all-protein composition, its lack of requirement 
for a protospacer adjacent motif, and its independence from CRISPR 
components—may also offer advantages for base editing in cells and 
organelles beyond mitochondria.

Methods

No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. The 
experiments were not randomized and the investigators were not 
blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment.

Bacterial strains and culture conditions
Unless otherwise noted, all bacterial strains used in this study were 
grown in Lysogeny Broth (LB) at 37 °C or on LB medium solidified with 
agar (LBA, 1.5% w/v, except as noted). When required, media was sup-
plemented with the following: carbenicillin (150 μg ml−1) gentamycin (15 
μg ml−1), IPTG (80 μM, except as noted), rhamnose (0.05% w/v, except 
as noted), chloramphenicol (10 μg ml−1) or tetracycline (20 μg ml−1 for 
E. coli, 120 μg ml−1 for B. cenocepacia). E. coli strains DH5α, XK1502 and 
BL21 were used for plasmid maintenance, toxicity and mutagenesis 
assays, and protein expression, respectively. B. cenocepacia strains 
were derived from the cystic fibrosis clinical isolate H111. A detailed 
description of the bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study is 
provided in Supplementary Table 11.

Genetic techniques and plasmid construction for bacterial 
expression
All procedures for DNA manipulation and transformation were per-
formed with standard methods. Molecular biology reagents, Phusion 
high fidelity DNA polymerase, restriction enzymes, and Gibson Assem-
bly Reagent were obtained from New England Biolabs (NEB). GoTaq 
Green Master Mix was obtained from Promega. Primers and gBlocks 
used in this study were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies 
(IDT). A list of all primers used in bacterial studies is provided in Sup-
plementary Table 12.
Protein expression constructs were generated by Gibson assembly. 
The toxin domain of DddA was identified by remote homology with 
characterized deaminase domains identified through HMMER36. For 
functional protein expression assays of DddAtox, TadA and CDD, the 
relevant genes or gene fragments were amplified from B. cenocepacia 
(DddAtox) or E. coli genomic DNA and cloned into the vector pSCRhaB2. 
The gene encoding DddIA was amplified from B. cenocepacia and cloned 
into pPSV39, and the expression construct for DddAtox(E1347A) was 
generated by overlap extension PCR followed by Gibson assembly 
with pSCRhaB2. For the APOBEC3G expression construct, the gene 
sequence was codon optimized for expression in E. coli, generated by 
synthesis as a gBLOCK (IDT) and cloned into pSCRhaB2. For protein 
purification, genes encoding DddAtox and DddAI were amplified from 
B. cenocepacia and cloned into pETDuet.
In-frame gene deletions and nucleotide substitutions in B. ceno-
cepacia were performed by homologous recombination using the 
plasmid pDONRPEX18Tp-SceI-pheS, followed by counter-selection 
using the plasmid pDAI-SceI and plasmid curing using 0.1% (w/v) 
p-chlorophenylalanine, as described previously37. B. cenocepacia 
contains two complete T6SSs38 and both were inactivated (∆icmF1, 
I35_RS01770; ∆icmF2, I35_RS17395) and tested in this study. The 
∆icmF2 mutation did not influence DddA-dependent intercellular 
intoxication and is thus not included in Fig. 1b for the sake of brev-
ity. Gentamycin-resistant B. cenocepacia was generated by insertion 
of a resistance cassette at the Tn7 site attachment site as described 
previously39.

Plasmid construction for mammalian expression
PCR was performed using Phusion U Green Multiplex PCR Master Mix 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific), Phusion U Green Hot Start DNA Polymerase 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) or Q5 Hot Start High-Fidelity DNA Polymer-
ase (New England Biolabs). All plasmids were constructed using USER 
cloning (New England Biolabs). DddAtox and mitoTALE genes were syn-
thesized as gene blocks and codon optimized for human expression 
(Genscript). BE4max was obtained according to a previous report30. 

BE2max (rAPOBEC1–dSpCas9–UGI–UGI) was cloned from a BE4max 
plasmid. Compared with BE214, BE2max contains an extra UGI protein 
and uses codon optimization from BE4max. DddAtox–Cas9 fusions and 
DdCBE variants were cloned into pCMV (mammalian codon-optimized) 
backbones. sgRNA plasmids were constructed by blunt-end ligation of 
a linear polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product generated by encod-
ing the 20- to 23-nt variable protospacer sequence onto the 5′ end of an 
amplification primer and treating the resulting piece with KLD Enzyme 
Mix (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 
Mach1 chemically competent E. coli cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific) 
were used for plasmid construction. E. coli strain DH5α:dddI was used to 
construct intact DddAtox–Cas9 plasmids. Plasmids for mammalian trans-
fection were purified using ZymoPURE II Plasmid Midiprep Kits (Zymo 
Research), as previously described40. A list of all primers used in mam-
malian expression constructs is provided in Supplementary Table 13.

Bacterial competition experiments
Bacterial competition experiments were used to evaluate the fitness of 
B. cenocepacia strains in interbacterial interactions. Donor and recipi-
ent strains were grown overnight and mixed in a 10:1 (v/v) ratio for donor 
and recipient, respectively. Cell suspensions were then concentrated to 
a total optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 10, and 10 μl was spotted on a 
0.2 μm nitrocellulose membrane placed on LBA (3% w/v) and incubated 
for 6 h at 37 °C. After incubation, cells were scraped from the membrane 
surface and resuspended in 1 ml LB. The initial donor:recipient ratio 
and the post-incubation ratio were determined by plating on LB agar 
(LBA) to determine the total number of colony forming units (cfu) and 
on LBA with gentamycin to quantify cfu of the recipient strain.

Toxicity assays
To evaluate the toxicity of deaminases expressed heterologously, over-
night cultures of E. coli XK1502 containing the appropriate plasmids 
were diluted 1:1,000 into fresh medium and grown until they reached 
exponential phase (OD600 0.6), at which point deaminase expression 
was induced with rhamnose (0.2% w/v). Aliquots of cultures were then 
collected periodically until 480 min of growth and were diluted and 
plated onto LBA for c.f.u determination.

Crystallization and structure determination
Crystals of the selenomethionine derivative hexahistidine-tagged 
DddAtox (aa 1264–1427)·DddIA complex were obtained at 5–10 mg 
ml−1 in crystallization buffer (15 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1.0 mM 
tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP)), mixed 1:1 with crystallization 
solution containing 25% (w/v) PEG 3350, 0.1 M Bis-Tris:HCl pH 6.5,  
200 mM MgCl2. Rectangular crystals grew to 400 × 200 × 100 μm over  
5 days. Selenomethionine DddAtox·DddIA crystals displayed the 
symmetry of space group P21212 (a = 126.8 Å, b = 145.0 Å, c = 64.2 Å, 
α = β = γ = 90°), with four dimers in the asymmetric unit. Before data 
collection, crystals were cryoprotected in crystallization solution  
(15% glycerol, 25% PEG3350, 100 mM MgCl2, 100 mM NaCl, 7.5 mM Tris 
pH 7.5, 50 mM Bis-Tris pH 6.5, 0.5 mM TCEP).
Highly redundant anomalous (SAD) data were obtained at 0.9790 Å  
(peak) wavelength from a single selenomethionine crystal at 100 K 
temperature at the BL502 beamline (ALS, Lawrence Berkeley National 
Laboratory). Data were processed using HKL200041. Heavy-atom 
searching using phenix.autosol identified 18 possible sites, and refine-
ment yielded an estimated Bayes correlation coefficient of 55.9 to 2.5 Å 
resolution. After density modification, the estimated Bayes correlation 
coefficient increased to 61.2. Approximately 70% of the selenomethio-
nine model was constructed automatically, and the remaining portion 
was built manually. The current model (Supplementary Table 1) con-
tains four DddA·DddIA dimers.
Refinement was carried out against peak anomalous data with 
Bijvoet pairs kept separate using phenix.refine42 interspersed with 
manual model revisions using the program Coot43 and consisted of 

conjugate-gradient minimization and calculation of individual atomic 
displacement and translation/libration/screw parameters44. Residues 
that could not be identified in the electron density were: 1250–1289 and 
1423–1427 for DddA, and 71–73 for DddIA. Both models exhibit excel-
lent geometry, as determined by MolProbity45. Ramachandran analysis 
identified 99.1% favoured, 0.9% allowed and 0% disallowed residues 
for the model. Coordinates and structure factors are deposited in the 
RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB ID: 6U08).

Mutation frequency determination and SNP generation assay
To determine the frequency of mutations induced by expression of 
DddAtox and DddAtox(E1347A), overnight cultures of E. coli containing 
the expression plasmids for these proteins together with the plasmid 
for expression of DddIA were diluted 1:1,000 into fresh medium and 
grown until they reached the exponential phase (OD600 0.6). The cul-
tures were then induced with IPTG (80 μM) for DddIA and rhamnose 
(0.04% w/v) for DddAtox or DddAtox(E1347A) expression. The combined 
expression of both toxin and immunity proteins at this low level ena-
bles the cells expressing DddAtox to suffer growth arrest but does not 
result in a decrease in culture viability. After 1 h under these inducing 
conditions, cultures were supplemented with 1 mM of IPTG to increase 
DddIA expression and thus block DddA toxicity and were then grown 
for an additional 16 h. After this recovery period, the cultures were 
plated onto LBA containing rifampicin (100 μg ml−1) or no antibiotics. 
Mutation frequency was determined dividing the number of rifampicin 
resistant colonies by the total c.f.u obtained on non-selective medium.
For the genome-wide identification of SNPs that accumulate after low 
level expression of DddAtox or DddAtox(E1347A), E. coli Δudg strain car-
rying plasmids for expression of one of these proteins plus the plasmid 
for expressing DddIA was submitted to seven rounds of expression and 
recovery as described above, with cultures being plated after recovery 
and single colonies being selected and used to inoculate the subsequent 
round of expression. Randomly chosen single colonies were used to 
avoid introducing selection for increased fitness under the culture 
conditions46. Five isolated colonies from each starting population 
subjected to this regimen were selected for whole genome sequenc-
ing. We confirmed the presence of non-mutagenized DddAtox and 
DddAtox(E1347A) in these sequencing data.

Western blot for deaminase expression in E. coli
Western blotting to detect deaminases expressed in E. coli was per-
formed using rabbit anti-VSV-G (diluted 1:5,000, Sigma) and detected 
with anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary anti-
bodies (diluted 1:5,000, Sigma). Loading control was performed with 
mouse anti-RNAP (diluted 1:500, BioLegend) and detected with sheep 
anti-mouse (diluted 1:500, Millipore). Western blots were developed 
using chemiluminescent substrate (SuperSignal West Pico Substrate, 
Thermo Scientific) and imaged with a C600 imager (Azure Biosystems).

Western blot for deaminase expression in mammalian cells
HEK293T cells were transfected as described below. For preparation of 
cell lysate for western blot analysis of DdCBE, cells were lysed in 150 μl 
of ice-cold 1x RIPA buffer (Sigma) with added protease inhibitor (Roche 
Complete Mini) by incubating for 30 min at 4 °C with agitation. Lysates 
were cleared by pelleting at 12,000g for 10 min at 4 °C.
Next, 60 μl of cleared lysate supernatant was added to 20 μl of 4X 
LDS sample loading buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with a final DTT 
(Sigma Aldrich) concentration of 10 mM. Lysates were boiled for 10 
min at 95 °C. Then 15–20 μl of protein lysate was loaded into the wells 
of a Bolt 4–12% Bis-Tris Plus (Thermo Fisher Scientific) pre-cast gel. 6 μl  
of Precision Plus Protein Dual Colour Standard (Bio-Rad) was used as 
a reference. Samples were separated by electrophoresis at 180 V for  
45 min in Bolt MES SDS running buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Trans-
fer to a PVDF membrane was performed using an iBlot 2 Gel Transfer 
Device (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s 

protocols. The membrane was blocked in Odyssey Blocking Buffer 
(LI-COR) for 1 h at room temperature, then incubated with rat anti-Flag 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific MA1-142; 1:2,000 dilution), mouse anti-HA 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific 26183; 1:2,000 dilution) and rabbit anti-actin 
(CST 4970; 1:2,000 dilution) in blocking buffer (0.5% Tween-20 in 1x 
PBS, 0.2 μm filtered) overnight at 4 °C. The membrane was washed 
three times with TBST (1x TBS in 0.5% Tween-20, 0.2-μm filtered) for 
10 min each at room temperature, then incubated with IRDye-labelled 
secondary antibodies goat anti-rat 680RD (LI-COR 926-68076), goat 
anti-mouse 800CW (LI-COR 926-32210) and donkey anti-rabbit 800CW 
(LI-COR 926–32213) diluted 1:5,000 in blocking buffer for 1 h at room 
temperature. The membrane was washed as before, then imaged using 
an Odyssey Imaging System (LI-COR).

Mitochondria isolation and blue-native-PAGE analysis
Mitochondria isolation was performed as described47. Cells were col-
lected from the plates by pipetting in NKM buffer (1 mM Tris–HCl,  
pH 7.4, 130 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 7.5 mM MgCl2) followed by centrifu-
gation at 400g at 4 °C for 8 min. Pellets were resuspended in ice-cold 
0.1x homogenization buffer (4 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 2.5 mM NaCl, 
0.5 mM MgCl2) and incubated for 5 min on ice. Twenty strokes of a 
tight-fitting pestle (Dounce homogenizer) were applied to homog-
enize cells and buffer was adjusted to isotonic conditions by addition of 
one-ninth volume of 10x homogenization buffer. Cell debris and nuclei 
were pelleted by two succeeding centrifugations at 900g at 4 °C for  
4 min and mitochondria were collected by centrifugation at 10,000g at 
4 °C for 2 min. Then 50 μg of mitochondria were suspended in Native-
PAGE solubilization buffer (Thermo Fisher) with addition of digitonin 
at a ratio of 4 g digitonin per g protein and incubated on ice for 10 min. 
Samples were centrifuged 16,000g at 4 °C for 10 min, supernatants were 
collected to new tubes and NativePAGE G-250 Sample Additive (Thermo 
Fisher) was added to each sample to a final concentration of 0.25%. 
Samples were loaded onto NativePAGE 3–12% Bis-Tris Gels (Thermo 
Fisher) and electrophoresis was performed with the use of NativePAGE 
Running Buffer system (Thermo Fisher) at constant 150 V for 45 min 
at 4 °C followed by 250 V for 90 min at room temperature. After initial 
45 min electrophoresis, the Dark Blue Cathode Buffer was replaced 
with the Light Blue Cathode Buffer. After electrophoresis, transfer 
to a PVDF membrane (BioRad) was performed using semi-dry Trans 
Blot Turbo transfer system (BioRad). Membranes were incubated for 
5 min in 8% v/v acetic acid and washed briefly with methanol following 
5 min incubation in distilled H2O. Membranes were washed twice with 
TBST (TBS-Tween-20, Boston BioProducts) and blocked with 5% w/v 
Blotting-Grade Blocker (BioRad) in TBST. Membranes were incubated 
with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C (mouse anti-NDUFA9, Abcam 
14713, 1:1,000 dilution; rabbit anti-UQCRC2, Abcam 103616, 1:1,000 
dilution; mouse anti-ATP5A, Abcam 14748, 1:6,000 dilution; mouse 
anti-MTCO2, Abcam 110258, 1:1,000 dilution; mouse anti-SDHB, Abcam 
14714, 1:1,000 dilution). Membranes were washed 3 times for 10 min 
with TBST and incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 h at room tem-
perature followed by washing 3 times for 10 min with TBST. Membranes 
were incubated with Western Lightning Plus-ECL (PerkinElmer) and 
signal was registered on the Amersham Hyperfilm high performance 
autoradiography film (GE Healthcare). Films were scanned and 8-bit 
greyscale files were used for quantification with Fiji software48. For 
each image, a region of interest of the same size was used to quantify 
all bands and their corresponding background signals. Obtained values 
were inverted so that white pixels = 0 and black pixels = 255. Net values 
were calculated as a difference between band values and background 
values. Obtained net values were used to calculate the protein ratio of 
ND4-DdCBE-treated cells relative to mock-edited cells.

Purification of proteins for bacterial biochemical assays
Overnight cultures of E. coli BL21 pETDuet-1::dddAtox-dddIA, or E. coli 
BL21 pETDuet-1::dddAtox(E1347A) were used to inoculate 2 l of LB broth 

in a 1:100 dilution and cultures were grown to approximately OD600 0.6. 
At this point, plasmid expression was induced with 0.5 mM IPTG and 
the cultures were incubated for 16 h at 18 °C in a shaking incubator. Cell 
pellets were collected by centrifugation at 4,000g for 20 min, followed 
by resuspension in 50 ml of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 500 mM 
NaCl, 30 mM imidazole, 1 mM DTT, and 1 mg ml−1 lysozyme). Cell pellets 
were then lysed by sonication (5 pulses, 10 s each) and supernatant was 
separated by centrifugation at 25,000g for 30 min.
The DddAtox–DddIA complex or DddAtox(E1347A) was purified from cell 
lysates by nickel affinity chromatography using 4 ml of Ni-NTA agarose 
beads loaded onto a gravity-flow column. The supernatant was loaded 
onto the column and resin was washed with 50 ml of wash buffer (50 mM  
Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 30 mM imidazole, 1 mM DTT). Pro-
teins of interest were eluted with 5 ml elution buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl  
pH 7.5, 300 mM imidazole, 500 mM NaCl, 30 mM imidazole, 1 mM DTT). 
When DddAtox(E1347A) was purified, the eluted samples were applied 
directly to size-exclusion chromatography. For DddA–DddIA, the eluted 
samples underwent a denaturation and renaturation step to isolate only 
the toxin. In this case, the eluted proteins were added to 50 ml 8 M urea 
denaturing buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 300 mM imidazole, 500 mM 
NaCl and 1 mM DTT) and incubated for 16 h at 4 °C. The 8 M urea denatur-
ing buffer with the eluted proteins was loaded on a gravity-flow column 
with 4 ml Ni-NTA agarose beads. The column was washed with 50 ml 8 M 
urea denaturing buffer to remove any remaining DddIA. While still bound 
to Ni-NTA agarose beads, DddAtox was renatured by sequential washes 
with 25 ml denaturing buffer with decreasing concentrations of urea  
(6 M, 4 M, 2 M, 1 M), and a last wash with wash buffer to remove remaining 
traces of urea. Proteins bound to the column were then eluted with 5 ml 
elution buffer. The eluted samples were purified again by size-exclusion 
chromatography using fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) with 
gel filtration on a Superdex200 column (GE Healthcare) in sizing buffer 
(20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 5% (w/v) glycerol). The 
fraction purity was evaluated by SDS–PAGE gel stained with Coomassie 
blue and the highest quality factions were stored at −80 °C.

DNA deamination assays
All the DNA substrates were purchased from IDT, and a 6-FAM fluoro-
phore was added for visualization (see Supplementary Table 12 for 
substrate sequences). Reactions were performed in 10 μl of deamina-
tion buffer (20 mM MES pH 6.4, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 8% Ficoll 70 
and 1 μM substrate) with APOBEC3A, DddAtox or DddAtox(E1347A) at the 
concentrations indicated in Fig. 1f, g and Extended Data Fig. 1d. Reac-
tions were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, followed by the addition of 5 μl of 
UDG solution (New England Biolabs, 0.02 U μl−1 UDG in 1X UDG buffer) 
and further incubated for 30 min. Cleavage of substrates was induced 
by addition of 100 mM NaOH and incubation at 95 °C for 3 min. Samples 
were analysed by denaturing 15% acrylamide gel electrophoresis and 
the resulting fluorescent DNA fragments were detected by fluorescence 
imaging with Azure Biosystems.

Poisoned primer extension assay for RNA deamination
All substrate sequences are listed in Supplementary Table 12. The RNA 
substrates and the oligonucleotide containing a 5′ 6-FAM fluorophore 
for visualization were purchased from IDT. Deamination reactions were 
performed in 10 μl of RNA deamination buffer (Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 200 mM 
NaCl, 1 mM DTT) with the addition of 1 μM of DddAtox or DddAtox(E1347A). 
Substrate combinations and concentrations were added as indicated in 
Extended Data Fig. 1e, f, and reactions were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. 
cDNA synthesis was performed in a 10-μl reaction (2.5 U μl−1 MultiScribe 
Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Fisher), 1 μl deamination reaction,  
1.5 μM oligonucleotide, 100 μM dATP, 100 μM dCTP, 100 μM dTTP, and 
100 μM ddGTP). The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min and 
samples were analysed by denaturing 15% acrylamide gel electropho-
resis. The synthesized cDNA fragments were detected by fluorescence 
imaging with a C600 (Azure Biosystems).

Genome sequencing and SNP identification in bacteria
Overnight cultures from isolated colonies were used for total gDNA 
extraction with the DNeasy Blood & Tissue kit (Qiagen), and extraction 
yield was quantified using a Qubit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Sequenc-
ing libraries were constructed using the Nextera DNA Flex Library Prep 
Kit (Illumina). Library quality and concentration was evaluated with a 
Qubit and TapeStation System (Agilent). Sequencing was performed 
with an Illumina MiSeq instrument (300 cycles paired end program). 
Genome mapping was performed with BWA49 using the E. coli MG1655 
(NC_000913.3) genome as a reference. Pileup data from alignments 
were generated with SAMtools and variant calling was performed with 
VarScan250. SNPs were considered valid if they were present at a fre-
quency greater than 90%.

Mammalian cell culture
All cells were cultured and maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Anti-
biotics were not used for cell culture of HEK293T cells, U2OS cells, 
T-Rex-293-based POLGdn cells and primary fibroblasts. HEK293T cells 
(CRL-3216, American Type Culture Collection (ATCC)) were cultured in 
DMEM with GlutaMax (Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 
10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Gibco). U2OS cells (HTB-96, ATCC) were 
cultured in McCoy’s 5A medium with GlutaMax (Thermo Fisher Scien-
tific) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Gibco). HeLa 
cells (ATCC CCL-2) were cultured in high glucose DMEM (Gibco) with 
10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biological), and 100 U ml−1 penicillin 
(Sigma-Aldrich). Primary human fibroblasts (GM04541, Coriell) were 
cultured in DMEM with GlutaMAX supplemented with 20% (v/v) FBS 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific). T-Rex-293-based POLGdn cells31 were cul-
tured in DMEM with GlutaMax (Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented 
with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Gibco), 1 mM sodium pyruvate and  
50 μg ml−1 uridine (Sigma-Aldrich). Cell lines were authenticated by 
their respective suppliers and tested negative for mycoplasma.

HEK293T and T-Rex-293-based POLGdn mammalian cell 
lipofection
Cells were seeded on 48-well collagen-coated plates (Corning) at a den-
sity of 2 × 105 cells per ml (250 μl total per well), 18–24 h before lipofec-
tion. Lipofection was performed at a cell density of approximately 70%. 
For split DddAtox–Cas9 screening, cells were transfected with 375 ng  
of split DddAtox–dSpCas9 monomer expression plasmid, 375 ng of split 
DddAtox–SaKKH-Cas9(D10A) monomer expression plasmid, 125 ng of 
SpCas9 guide RNA (gRNA) expression plasmid and 125 ng of SaKKH 
gRNA plasmid. pUC19 was used as a filler DNA for monomer and 
no-gRNA control experiments to make up to 1,000 ng of total plasmid 
DNA. For DdCBE experiments, cells were transfected with 500 ng of 
each mitoTALE monomer to make up 1,000 ng of total plasmid DNA. 
Lipofectamine 2000 (1.5 μl, Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used per 
well. Cells were collected at the indicated time point.
For western blot analysis of DdCBEs expressed in mammalian cells, 
HEK293T cells were seeded on 6-well tissue culture-treated plates 
(Corning) at a density of 2 × 105 cells per ml (2 ml total per well), 18–24 h  
before lipofection. Cells were transfected with 4,000 ng of each 
mitoTALE monomer to make up 8,000 ng of total plasmid DNA. Lipo-
fectamine 2000 (12 μl; ThermoFisher Scientific) was used per well. 
Cells were collected at the indicated time point.

U2OS cell plasmid nucleofection
We combined 500 ng of Left DdCBE monomer and 500 ng of Right 
DdCBE monomer in a volume that did not exceed 2 μl. This combined 
plasmid mixture was nucleofected in a final volume of 22 μl per sample 
in a 16-well Nucleocuvette strip (Lonza). U2OS cells were nucleofected 
using the SE Cell Line 4D-Nucleofector X Kit (Lonza) with 30,000–
50,000 cells per sample (program DN-100), according to the manu-
facturer’s protocol.

Cas9 mRNA in vitro transcription
A DNA fragment containing a T7 promoter driving expression of 
polyadenylated Cas9 transcript was isolated from purified plasmid 
(5 μg) using SpeI-HF restriction digestion (New England Biolabs) and 
purified with the MinElute PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen). mRNA was 
transcribed using the HiScribe T7 ARCA mRNA Kit (NEB) and purified 
using MEGAclear Transcription Clean-up kit (Thermo Fisher) according 
to the manufacturer’s instructions and stored at −80 °C.

Human primary fibroblast nucleofection
Human primary fibroblasts were nucleofected as previously described51. 
In brief, 500 ng of in vitro-transcribed Left-DdCBE mRNA and 500 ng of 
in vitro-transcribed Right-DdCBE mRNA were combined in a volume 
that did not exceed 2 μl. This combined mRNA mixture was nucleo-
fected in a final volume of 22 μl per sample in a 16-well Nucleocuvette 
strip (Lonza). Human primary fibroblasts (GM04541, Coriell) were 
nucleofected using the P2 Primary Cell 4D-Nucleofector kit (Lonza) 
with 2.5 × 105 cells per sample (program DS-150), according to the manu-
facturer’s protocol. The medium was changed after 24 h of nucleofec-
tion and cultured for 5 days before collection for high-throughput 
sequencing.

Cell viability assays
Cell viability was measured every 3 to 6 days over an 18-day time 
course using the CellTiter-Glo 2.0 assay (Promega) according to the 
manufacturer’s protocol. Luminescence was measured in 96-well flat 
black-bottomed polystyrene microplates (Corning) using a M1000 Pro 
microplate reader (Tecan) with a 1-s integration time.

Genomic DNA isolation from mammalian cell culture
Medium was removed, and cells were washed once with 1× Dulbecco’s 
phosphate-buffered saline (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Genomic DNA 
extraction was performed by addition of 40 μl freshly prepared lysis 
buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.05% SDS, and proteinase K (20 μg ml−1;  
Thermo Fisher Scientific)) directly into the 48-well culture well. The 
extraction solution was incubated at 37 °C for 60 min and then 80 °C for 
20 min. The resulting genomic DNA was subjected to bead cleanup with 
AMPure DNAdvance beads according to the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions (Beckman Coulter A48705).
For DNA isolation and Sanger sequencing of ND4-edited cells, total 
DNA was extracted from cells with the use of DNeasy Blood & Tissue 
Kit (Qiagen). The ND4 gene fragment spanning the edited m.11922 site 
was amplified with the use of AccuPrime Taq DNA Polymerase System 
(Thermo Fisher). Primers used for the PCR are listed in Supplementary 
Table 13. PCR reaction products were purified by gel extraction with the 
use of QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen) and subjected to Sanger 
sequencing at Genwiz.

High-throughput DNA sequencing of genomic DNA samples
Genomic sites of interest were amplified from genomic DNA samples 
and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq as previously described with the 
following modifications52. Amplification primers containing Illumina 
forward and reverse adapters (Supplementary Table 13) were used for 
a first round of PCR (PCR 1) to amplify the genomic region of interest. 
In brief, 1 μl of purified genomic DNA was used as input into the first 
round of PCR (PCR1). For PCR1, DNA was amplified to the top of the 
linear range using Phusion Hot Start II High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific), according to the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions but with the addition of 0.5x SYBR Green Nucleic Acid Gel Stain 
(Lonza) in each 25-μl reaction. For all amplicons, the PCR1 protocol 
used was an initial heating step of 2 min at 98 °C followed by an opti-
mized number of amplification cycles (10 s at 98 °C, 20 s at 62 °C, 30 s 
at 72 °C). Quantitative PCR was performed to determine the optimal 
cycle number for each amplicon. The number of cycles needed to reach 

the top of the linear range of amplification are about 27–28 cycles for 
nuclear DNA amplicons and about 17–19 cycles for mtDNA amplicons. 
Barcoding PCR2 reactions (25 μl) were performed with 1 μl of unpuri-
fied PCR1 product and amplified with Q5 Hot Start MasterMix (NEB) 
using the following protocol: 98 °C for 2 min, then 9 cycles of (98 °C for  
10 s, 61 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 30 s), followed by a final 72 °C extension 
for 2 min. PCR products were evaluated analytically by electrophore-
sis in a 1.5% agarose gel. After PCR2, up to 300 samples with different 
barcode combinations were combined and purified by gel extraction 
using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen). DNA concentration 
was quantified using the Qubit ssDNA HS Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher 
Scientific) to make up a 4 nM library. The library concentration was 
further verified by qPCR (KAPA Library Quantification Kit-Illumina, 
Kapa Biosystems) and sequenced using an Illumina MiSeq with 210- to 
300-bp single-end reads.

Analysis of high-throughput sequencing data for DNA 
sequencing and targeted amplicon sequencing
Sequencing reads were demultiplexed using MiSeq Reporter (Illumina). 
Batch analysis with CRISPResso253 was used for targeted amplicon and 
DNA sequencing analysis. A 10-bp window was used to quantify indels 
centred around the middle of the dsDNA spacing. To set the cleavage 
offset, a hypothetical 15-or 16-bp spacing region has a cleavage offset 
of −8. Otherwise, the default parameters were used for analysis. The 
output file “Reference.NUCLEOTIDE_PERCENTAGE_SUMMARY.txt” was 
imported into Microsoft Excel for quantification of editing frequen-
cies. Reads containing indels within the 10-bp window are excluded for 
calculation of editing frequencies. The output file “CRISPRessoBatch_
quantification_of_editing_frequency.txt” was imported into Microsoft 
Excel for quantification of indel frequencies. Indel frequencies were 
computed by dividing the sum of insertions and deletions over the 
total number of aligned reads.

Determination of relative total mitochondrial DNA levels by 
quantitative PCR
Quantitative PCR (qPCR) reactions were performed on a Bio-Rad 
CFX96/C1000 qPCR machine performed using SYBR green (Lonza). 
For Extended Data Fig. 6i, 5 ng of purified DNA was used as template 
input in a 25-μl reaction volume. For Extended Data Fig. 8a, 8 ng of 
purified DNA was used as template input in a 25-μl reaction volume. 
For all reactions, the protocol used was an initial heating step of 
2 min at 98 °C followed by 40 cycles of amplification (10 s at 98 °C, 
20 s at 62 °C, 15 s at 72 °C). Single threshold values (∆C) were deter-
mined by manufacturer’s software. For Extended Data Fig. 6i, the 
level of mtDNA was determined by the calculating the ratio of total 
mtDNA to genomic DNA (β-actin) (Ratio = EmtDNA
Eβ-actin ∆C(DdCBE – dead DdCBE), where E is the efficiency of the qPCR reaction; 
END6 = 0.858, END5 = 0.844, EATP8 = 0.995, Eβ-actin = 1.05). For the assessment 
of mtDNA level in Extended Data Fig. 8a, 8 ng of isolated DNA was used 
in qPCR reaction performed with the use of iQ SYBR Green Supermix 
(Bio-Rad). Relative abundance of the amplified ND1 gene fragment  
was normalized to the amplified B2M gene fragment. See Supplemen-
tary Table 13 for list of primers used. NC_012920 was used as the ref-
erence for mtDNA; NG_003019 was used as the reference for human 
ACTBP2.

∆C(DdCBE – dead DdCBE)/ 

RNA isolation and RT-qPCR
Total RNA was extracted from cells with the use of RNeasy Mini Kit 
(Qiagen) and digested with DNase I (Qiagen). Isolated RNA (500 ng) was 
used for reverse transcription performed with the use of SuperScript 
III First-Strand Synthesis SuperMix for qRT–PCR (Thermo Fisher). The 
obtained cDNA was used for qPCR. Analysis of mitochondrial gene 
expression was performed with the use of iQ SYBR Green Supermix 
(BioRad) using primers listed in Supplementary Table 13. Data was 
normalized to B2M abundance.

Oxygen consumption analysis by Seahorse XF analyser
Seahorse plate was coated with 0.01% (w/v) poly-l-lysine (Sigma). Cells 
(1.6 × 104) were seeded on the coated Seahorse plate 16 h before the anal-
ysis in the Seahorse XFe96 Analyzer (Agilent). Analysis was performed 
in the Seahorse XF DMEM Medium pH 7.4 (Agilent) supplemented with 
10 mM glucose (Agilent), 2 mM l-glutamine (Gibco) and 1 mM sodium 
pyruvate (Gibco). Mito stress protocol was applied with the use of  
1.5 mM oligomycin, 1 mM FCCP and 1 mM piericidin + 1 mM antimycin.

Complex I and IV activity assay
Complex I activity assay was performed with the use of colorimetric 
Complex I Enzyme Activity Microplate Assay Kit (Abcam) according to 
the manufacturer’s protocol. Complex IV activity assay was performed 
with the use of colorimetric Complex IV Human Enzyme Activity Micro-
plate Assay Kit (Abcam) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. In 
brief, cells were collected and washed twice with PBS (Gibco) followed 
by protein extraction and incubation of clarified cell lysates at concen-
tration of 0.25 mg ml−1 on the microplates for 3 h at room temperature. 
Complex I activity was determined by measurement of absorbance at 
OD = 450 nm, which is increased by reduction of a dye simultaneous 
to NADH to NAD+ oxidation. Complex IV activity was determined by 
measurement of absorbance at OD = 550 nm, which decreases follow-
ing oxidation of reduced cytochrome c.

Long-range PCR to detect mtDNA deletions
Long-range PCR was performed on purified genomic DNA as previously 
with listed primers (Supplementary Table 13) to capture the whole 
mtDNA genome as two overlapping fragment of around 8 kb each. In 
brief, around 50–200 ng of purified DNA was used as input for amplifi-
cation by PRIMESTAR GXL DNA polymerase (Takara). For all reactions, 
the protocol used was an initial heating step of 1 min at 94 °C followed 
by 30 cycles of amplification (30 s at 98 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, 9 min at 72 °C). 
Unpurified PCR products were run on 0.8% agarose gel and stained 
with ethidium bromide.

Immunocytochemical studies of DdCBE localization
HeLa cells were transfected with a total of 1 ug of plasmid DNA (500 ng 
for each monomer) to express left (HA-tagged) or right (Flag-tagged) 
monomers of each DdCBE using Lipofectamine 3000 (Thermo Fisher) 
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. After 24 h incubation, cells 
were labelled with MitoTracker Deep Red (Thermo Fisher) at a final 
concentration of 100 nM for 30 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator. Cells 
were then seeded on an 8-well chamber glass slide (Ibidi) and fixed in 
4% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 15 min at room temperature. Next, cells 
were washed twice with PBS and permeabilized in PBS containing 0.1% 
saponin and 1% BSA for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were then 
immunostained with anti-HA (Biolegend) or anti-Flag (Sigma Aldrich), 
followed by Alexa-Fluor conjugated anti-mouse (HA tag) or anti-rabbit 
(Flag tag) secondary antibodies (Thermo Fisher). Images were taken 
using a 60× objective with the high-resolution widefield Nikon system. 
Acquired images were processed in Fiji48.

Bulk ATAC–seq for whole mitochondrial genome sequencing
Assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing (ATAC–
seq) was performed as previously described54. In brief, 5,000–10,000 
cells were trypsinzed, washed with cold 1X PBS, pelleted by centrifuga-
tion (500g at 4 °C for 5 min) and lysed in 50 μl of cold and freshly pre-
pared lysis buffer (0.1% Igepal CA-360 (v/v %), 10 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM 
NaCl and 3 mM MgCl2 in nuclease-free water). Lysates were incubated 
on ice for 3 min, pelleted at 500g for 10 min at 4 °C and tagmented with 
2.5 μl of Tn5 transposase (Illumina, 15027865) in a total volume of 10 μl 
containing 1x TD buffer (Illumina, 15027866),0.1% NP-40 (Sigma) and 
0.3x PBS. Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min on a thermomixer 
at 300 rpm. DNA was purified using the MinElute PCR Kit (Qiagen) 

and eluted in 10 μl elution buffer. All 10 μl of the eluate was amplified 
using indexed primers (1.25 μM each) listed in Supplementary Table 13 
and NEBNext High-Fidelity 2X PCR Master Mix (NEB) in a total volume 
of 50 μl using the following protocol: 72 °C for 5 min, 98 °C for 30 s, 
then 5 cycles of (98 °C for 10 s, 63 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 60 s), fol-
lowed by a final 72 °C extension for 1 min. After the initial 5 cycles of 
pre-amplification, 5 μl of partially amplified library was used as input 
DNA in a total volume of 15 μl for quantitative PCR using SYBR Green 
(0.5x, Lonza) to determine the number of additional cycles needed to 
reach 1/3 of the maximum fluorescence intensity. Typically, 3–8 cycles 
were conducted on the remaining 45 μl of partially amplified library. 
The final library was purified using a MinElute PCR kit (Qiagen) and 
quantified using a Qubit dsDNA HS Assay kit (Invitrogen) and a High 
Sensitivity DNA chip run on a Bioanalyzer 2100 system (Agilent). All 
libraries were sequenced using Nextseq High Output Cartridge kits on 
an Illumina Nextseq 500 sequencer. Libraries were sequenced using 
paired-end 2×75 cycles and demultiplexed using the bcl2fastq program.

Targeted amplicon sequencing for nuclear DNA off-target 
analyses
Genomic DNA was isolated and purified as described in the section 
“Genomic DNA isolation from mammalian cell culture”. The on-target 
mtDNA binding sites for ND6-, ND5.1- and ND4-DdCBE were aligned to 
the NCBI reference sequence for human chromosome 5 (NC_000005.10) 
to identify MTND6P4, MTND5P11 and MTND4P12. These pseudogenes 
are regions in the nuclear DNA that contain the greatest homology to 
their respective DdCBE binding sites in mtDNA. Samples were pre-
pared for high-throughput sequencing as described in the section 
“High-throughput DNA sequencing of genomic DNA samples”. The 
following primers were used for appending sequencing adapters to 
MTND6P4: MTND6P4 forward: ACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCC 
GATCTNNNNGTTGTAGCCCGTGCAAGAATAATG; MTND6P4 reverse: 
TGGAGTTCAGACGTGTGCTCTTCCGATCTTAACACTAATCCTACTTCC 
ATC. For MTND5P11 and MTND4P12, a 5 kb region was amplified with 
primer set 1 (Forward 1 and Forward 2) to ensure selective ampli-
fication of nuclear DNA rather than mtDNA. The 5-kb fragment was 
purified using MinElute PCR Kit (Qiagen) and used as the DNA input 
for subsequent amplification steps using the indicated sequencing 
adaptor primers: Forward 1: CTAATTCTCTTTGAGGAGCATGGTTAG; 
Forward 2: TATCACTTCCAGCCACCTATTTCC; MTND5P11 forward: 
ACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCTNNNNGGAAGCGAGG

Genome sequencing and SNP identification in mitochondria
SNP identification in mitochondria was performed similarly to in bac-
teria, with the following modifications. Genome mapping was per-
formed with BWA (v.0.7.17) using NC_012920 genome as a reference. 
Duplicates were marked using Picard tools (v.2.20.7). Pileup data from 
alignments were generated with SAMtools (v.1.9) and variant calling 
was performed with VarScan2 (v.2.4.3). Variants that were present at a 
frequency greater than 0.1% and a P value less than 0.05 (Fisher’s exact 
test) were called as high-confidence SNPs independently in each bio-
logical replicate. Only reads with a Phred quality score (Q) of greater 
than 30 at a given position were taken into account when calling SNPs 
at that particular position.

Calculation of average off-target C•G-to-T•A editing frequency
To calculate the mitochondrial genome-wide average off-target edit-
ing frequency for each DdCBE in Fig. 5b, we used REDItools (v.1.2.1)55. 
All nucleobases except cytosines and guanines were removed and the 
number of reads covering each C•G base pair with a Phred quality score 

greater than 30 (Q > 30) was calculated. The on-target C•G base pairs 
(depending on the DdCBE used in each treatment) were excluded in 
order to consider only off-target effects. C•G-to-T•A SNVs present at 
high frequencies (greater than 50%) in both treated and untreated 
samples (that therefore did not arise from DdCBE treatment) were also 
excluded. The average off-target editing frequency was then calculated 
independently for each biological replicate of each treatment condition 
as: (number of reads in which a given C•G base pair was called as a T•A 
base pair, summed over all non-target C•G base pairs)/(total number 
of reads that covered all non-target C•G base pair). Sequence logos 
in Fig. 5c, depicting the local sequence context of all off-target SNVs, 
were generated as described previously56. For Supplementary Tables 8 
and 9, the average frequency of each SNV was calculated by taking the 
average of three frequencies from the biological triplicates.

Effect prediction of the C•G-to-T•A off-target SNVs identified by 
ATAC–seq
SIFT57 (https://sift.bii.a-star.edu.sg /) was used to predict the out-
come of nonsynonymous mutations on protein function. High- and 
low-confidence calls were made using standard SIFT parameters with 
GRCh37.74 database as the reference genome.

represent the mean ± s.d. of three technical replicates. The experiment was 
repeated three times with similar results. c, α-VSV-g western blot analysis of 
total cell lysates of E. coli expressing the indicated deaminases tagged with 
VSV-G epitope. RNAP-β was used as a loading control. Results are 
representative of n = 2 independent biological replicates. d, In vitro DNA 
cytidine deamination assays using double-stranded 36-nt DNA substrates 

containing AC, TC, CC, and GC with a FAM f luorophore on the forward (A) or 
reverse (B) strand. Deamination activity results in a cleaved product (P). Images 
are representative of n = 2 independent biological replicates. e, f, Poisoned 
primer extension assay to detect deamination of cytidine in single-stranded (e) 
or double-stranded (f ) RNA substrates. Images are representative of n = 2 
independent biological replicates. A mix of RNA substrates containing the 
sequences GUCG or GUUG at the indicated ratios were incubated with purif ied 
DddAtox and reverse transcriptase. Primer extension was performed in 
reactions with ddGTP to terminate primer extension at cytidines. Cytidine 
deamination yields the 31-mer product.

Extended Data Fig. 4 | TALE–split DddAtox proteins mediate ef f icient base 
editing in nuclear DNA of U2OS cells. a, Left–G1333-DddAtox-N and R ight–
G1333-DddAtox-C bind DNA sequences within CCR5. Target cytosines are shown 
in purple and TALE binding sites are shown in blue. Two copies of UGI proteins 
(2×-UGI) were fused to the N- or C terminus through a 2- or 16-amino acid linker. 
Editing eff iciencies and indel frequencies for the possible combinations of UGI 
positions and linker lengths are shown. In the absence of UGI protein, only 
C9-to-T9 edit was observed. b, Architecture of nuclear-targeting CCR5-DdCBE 

(see Fig. 3c for optimized DdCBE architecture targeting mtDNA). Target 
cytosines are shown in purple. c, Editing eff iciencies and indel frequencies of 
cells treated with CCR5-DdCBE and ND6-DdCBE 3-days-post transfection are 
shown. Dead-DdCBEs containing the inactive DddAtox(E1347A) mutant were 
used as negative controls. d, Outcomes among edited alleles in which the 
specif ied target C is mutated are shown for the indicated base editor. Values 
and error bars in a, c and d ref lect the mean ± s.d. of n = 3 independent 
biological replicates.

mediate modest editing of mitochondrial ND6 in HEK293T cells.  
a, Architectures of non-UGI containing ND6-mitoTALE–DddAtox fusion pair. 
DddAtox was split at G1333 or G1397, with each half fused to either the left TALE 
or the right TALE . TALEs bind to mtDNA sequences (blue) that f lank a 15-bp 

spacing region in mitochondrial ND6 . Target cytosines are shown in purple. 
The last TALE repeat (*) did not match the reference genome9 (see 
Supplementary Table 4). b, mtDNA editing eff iciencies of mitoTALE–DddAtox 
pairs in the listed split orientations. The dashed line is drawn at 0.1% . Values and 
error bars ref lect the mean ± s.d. of n = 3 independent biological replicates.

(denoted ND5 .1-DdCBE) (b), MTND5P2-DdCBE (denoted ND5 . 2-DdCBE) (c), 
ATP8-DdCBE (d) and BE2max and BE4max (e) are shown for each time point. 
C•G-to-T•A conversions at protein-coding genes that generate missense 
mutations (green) of the putative amino acid (red) are shown. f, Western blots 
of ND6 -, ND5 .1-, ND5 . 2- and ATP8-DdCBE at various time points. The right halves 
were Flag-tagged and the left halves were HA-tagged. Day 3 images are 
representative of n = 3 independent biological replicates; n = 1 for day 6 and day 
12 images (see Supplementary Data 3 for uncropped images and f luorescent 

tagging of each half ). Nuclear β-actin was used as a loading control. g, Cell 
viability was measured by recording the luminescence at the indicated time 
points. Luminescence values were normalized to the untreated control. h, DNA 
gel of PCR-amplif ied mtDNA captured as two amplicons (red). Images are 
representative of n = 3 independent biological replicates (see Supplementary 
Data 4 for uncropped images). i, mtDNA levels of DdCBE-edited cells were 
measured by qPCR relative to untreated cells. Values and error bars in a–e, g 
and i ref lect the mean ± s.d. of n = 3 independent biological replicates. For a–e, 
asterisks indicate signif icant editing based on a comparison between indicated 
time points. *P < 0.05 and **P < 0.01 by Student ’s two-tailed paired t-test. 
Individual P values are listed in Supplementary Table 7.

Data collection

High-throughput sequencing data was collected on Illumina Miseq and Nextseq instruments. 

Data analysis

High-throughput sequencing data was analyzed using CRISPResso2 Sequencing reads were demultiplexed using the MiSeq Reporter 
(Illumina) and fastq files were analyzed using Crispresso2. Prism 8 (GraphPad) was used to generate dot plots and bar plots of these data.  
For mitochondrial genome analysis, Genome mapping was performed with BWA (v0.7.17) using NC_012920 genome as a reference. 
Duplicates were marked using Picard tools (v2.20.7). Pileup data from alignments were generated with SAMtools (v1.9) and variant 
calling was performed with VarScan2 (v2.4.3). Variants that were present at a frequency greater than 0.1% and a p-value less than 0.05 
(Fisher’s Exact Test) were called as high-confidence SNPs independently in each biological replicate. Only reads with Q > 30 at a given 
position were taken into account when calling SNPs at that particular position. Further details and references and provided in the 
Methods. For the generation of sequence logos, flanking sequences were aligned, fixing the mutant cytosine in each case at position 21, 
and the resulting alignment was used to produce a sequence logo using WebLogo 3.6.0. Further details and references are provided in 
the Methods.

Bacterial toxins represent a vast reservoir of biochemical diversity that can be 
repurposed for biomedical applications. Such proteins include a group of predicted 
interbacterial toxins of the deaminase superfamily, members of which have found 
application in gene-editing techniques1,2. Because previously described cytidine 
deaminases operate on single-stranded nucleic acids3, their use in base editing 
requires the unwinding of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA)—for example by a CRISPR–
Cas9 system. Base editing within mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), however, has thus far 
been hindered by challenges associated with the delivery of guide RNA into the 
mitochondria4. As a consequence, manipulation of mtDNA to date has been limited to 
the targeted destruction of the mitochondrial genome by designer nucleases9,10.Here 
we describe an interbacterial toxin, which we name DddA, that catalyses the 
deamination of cytidines within dsDNA. We engineered split-DddA halves that are 
non-toxic and inactive until brought together on target DNA by adjacently bound 
programmable DNA-binding proteins. Fusions of the split-DddA halves, transcription 
activator-like effector array proteins, and a uracil glycosylase inhibitor resulted in 
RNA-free DddA-derived cytosine base editors (DdCBEs) that catalyse C•G-to-T•A 
conversions in human mtDNA with high target specificity and product purity. We used 
DdCBEs to model a disease-associated mtDNA mutation in human cells, resulting in 
changes in respiration rates and oxidative phosphorylation. CRISPR-free DdCBEs 
enable the precise manipulation of mtDNA, rather than the elimination of mtDNA 
copies that results from its cleavage by targeted nucleases, with broad implications 
for the study and potential treatment of mitochondrial disorders.

Inherited or acquired mutations in mtDNA are associated with a range 
of human diseases5,6. Tools for introducing specific modifications into 
mtDNA are urgently needed both to model and to potentially treat 
these diseases. The development of such tools, however, has been 
hindered by the challenge of transporting RNAs into mitochondria, 
including guide RNAs that are required to program CRISPR-associated 
proteins4.
Each mammalian cell contains many copies of a circular mtDNA that 
can exist in a heteroplasmic mixture of wild-type and mutant alleles7. 
Current approaches to manipulate mtDNA rely on RNA-free program-
mable nucleases, such as transcription activator-like effector nucleases 
(TALENs)8,9 and zinc finger nucleases10, fused to mitochondrial target-
ing signal (MTS) sequences to induce double-strand breaks in mtDNA. 
Linearized mtDNA is rapidly degraded11,12, resulting in heteroplasmic 
shifts to favour uncut mtDNA genomes. As a candidate therapeutic 
or disease-modelling tool, this approach cannot introduce specific 

nucleotide changes in mtDNA, and cannot be applied to homoplasmic 
mtDNA mutations because destroying all mtDNA copies is presumed 
to be harmful7,11.
An alternative to the targeted destruction of mtDNA through 
double-strand breaks is precision genome editing, a capability that—
to the best of our knowledge—has not been previously reported for 
mtDNA. The ability to precisely install or correct pathogenic mutations 
could accelerate the modelling of diseases caused by mtDNA mutations, 
facilitate preclinical drug candidate testing, and potentially enable 
therapeutic approaches that directly correct pathogenic mtDNA muta-
tions. Although cytidine and adenosine deaminases are important for 
precision genome editing by enabling base editing in the nucleus1,2,13,14, 
their biochemical and functional diversity remain largely unexplored. 
Bacterial genomes contain various uncharacterized deaminases15, rais-
ing the possibility that some may possess unique activities that enable 
new genome-editing capabilities.

An interbacterial deaminase-like toxin

Some predicted bacterial deaminases contain sequences that suggest 
them to be substrates for intercellular protein delivery systems, such as 
the type VI secretion system (T6SS)15. This system mediates antagonism 
between Gram-negative bacteria by transferring antibacterial toxins 
into contacting cells16,17. Given their sequence divergence from char-
acterized deaminases, we sought to define the biochemical activity of 
T6SS-associated deaminases. We focused on a predicted deaminase 
belonging to the SCP1.201-like family15, henceforth referred to as DddA, 
encoded by Burkholderia cenocepacia (Fig. 1a). A B. cenocepacia strain 
lacking dddA and the downstream predicted immunity gene (dddIA) 
exhibited a marked growth defect when co-cultivated with the wild-type 
strain (Fig. 1b, Extended Data Fig. 1a, b). This defect was not observed 
in co-culture with a strain that lacked the activity of a T6SS (∆icmF1) or 
with a strain that expressed DddA containing an amino acid substitution 
of a predicted catalytic residue (dddAE1347A) . These data establish DddA 
as an antibacterial toxin that is delivered by the T6SS.
Members of the deaminase superfamily are known to catalyse the 
deamination of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), RNA, free nucleosides, 
nucleotides, nucleobases and other nucleotide derivatives15. To define the 
substrate of DddA, which belongs to a clade of predicted deaminases that 
lack a characterized member15, we first determined whether deaminases 
that represent the substrate range of the superfamily are toxic if expressed 
in bacteria. The growth of Escherichia coli was unaffected by the production 
of deaminases that act on ssDNA, tRNA or free cytidine (Fig. 1c, Extended 
Data Fig. 1c). By contrast, DddA markedly reduced the viability of E. coli 
(Fig. 1c). We identified amino acids 1264–1427 of DddA as the domain that 
confers toxicity, referred to henceforth as DddAtox (see Methods for details 
of the identification of the toxin domain). These findings suggested that 
DddA may act on a previously undescribed deaminase substrate.

DddA is a double-stranded DNA deaminase

To further clarify the substrate and mechanism of DddAtox, we deter-
mined a co-crystal structure of DddAtox bound to the immunity protein 
DddIA at 2.5 Å resolution (Supplementary Table 1). DddAtox adopts a 
typical deaminase fold consisting of a five-stranded β-sheet with but-
tressing helices that contribute catalytic residues (Fig. 1d). DddIA con-
tains a central β-sheet that occludes the active site of DddAtox (Fig. 1d). 
Structure-based homology searches revealed APOBEC enzymes as the 
closest structural relatives of DddAtox, with divergence at the C-terminal 
β-strands; these strands are antiparallel with an extended intervening 
loop in DddAtox, whereas they are parallel with an intervening α-helix 
in APOBEC enzymes (Fig. 1d, e).
So far, all reported DNA cytidine deaminases operate predominantly on 
ssDNA, often with a preference for the base immediately 5′ of the substrate 
C3. We measured the in vitro activity of DddAtox on a ssDNA substrate con-
taining cytosine in all four possible 5′-NC contexts. Whereas the activity of 
APOBEC3A was readily detected, DddAtox did not catalyse uracil formation 
within ssDNA sequences (Fig. 1f ). As a control, we included a related dsDNA 
substrate. Consistent with previous studies18, APOBEC3A did not display 
measurable activity against dsDNA. Unexpectedly, however, DddAtox 
efficiently converted cytosine to uracil within dsDNA (Fig. 1g, Extended 
Data Fig. 1d). The catalytically inactive enzyme, DddAtox(E1347A), showed 
no uracil formation, indicating that deamination was dependent on the 
activity of DddAtox. We did not detect deamination of single-stranded or 
double-stranded RNA substrates by DddAtox (Extended Data Fig. 1e, f ). 
These results collectively establish DddAtox as a cytidine deaminase that 
operates preferentially on dsDNA; the enzyme was therefore named 
‘double-stranded DNA deaminase toxin A’, or DddA.
If DddAtox converts cytosine to uracil specifically within dsDNA, the 
enzyme should be mutagenic in a manner that is dependent on uracil

DNA glycosylase (UDG), which initiates base excision repair through 
uracil removal19. Indeed, expression of sub-lethal levels of DddAtox in  
E. coli substantially increased the mutation frequency, and these 
mutagenic effects of DddAtox were enhanced more than 100-fold in an  
E. coli strain lacking UDG (Fig. 1h). We next used the high mutation rate 
caused by sub-lethal DddAtox levels to profile the sequence context 
preference of the enzyme. We performed whole-genome sequencing 
on five E. coli lineages that experienced serial DddAtox exposure and 
clonal bottlenecking, and five control strains that underwent a simi-
lar regimen in the presence of DddAtox(E1347A). Consistent with our 
mutation-frequency measurements, we observed approximately 50-fold 
more total single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in strains exposed 
to active DddAtox (997) than in strains producing the inactive enzyme 
(17), and more than 99% of the DddAtox-dependent SNPs were C•G-to-T•A 
transitions (Extended Data Fig. 2a–c). The alignment of sequences flank-
ing the converted cytosine within these C•G-to-T•A mutations revealed 
a strong preference for 5′-TC contexts (Fig. 1i), matching the sequence 
preference of the enzyme in vitro (Extended Data Fig. 2d). Together, these 
findings reveal that DddAtox deaminates dsDNA substrates in vitro and 
in bacterial cells with a preference for 5′-TC contexts.

Splitting DddAtox into non-toxic halves

Current base editors deaminate nucleotides in ssDNA loops created by 
RNA-guided CRISPR proteins1,13,14. The ability of DddAtox to deaminate 
cytidines in dsDNA raises the possibility of using RNA-free program-
mable dsDNA-binding proteins, such as zinc-finger arrays20 or TALE 
repeat arrays21, to direct DddAtox to mtDNA targets without requiring 
CRISPR or guide RNAs.
As expected (Fig. 1b, c), the expression of intact DddAtox fused to 
programmable DNA-binding proteins was toxic to human HEK293T 

cells (Supplementary Discussion). To avoid this toxicity, we proposed 
splitting the protein into two inactive halves, one containing the N ter-
minus of DddAtox (DddAtox-N) and the other containing the C terminus 
(DddAtox-C). These halves would reconstitute deamination activity only 
when assembled adjacently on target DNA, analogous to the assembly 
of FokI monomers to reconstitute dsDNA nuclease activity in zinc finger 
nucleases20 and TALENs21.
On the basis of the DddAtox–DddIA co-crystal structure, we split DddAtox 
into DddAtox-N and DddAtox-C halves at seven sites within loops (Fig. 2a), 
naming each split to reflect the last residue of DddAtox-N. Screening of 
split sites was performed with CRISPR–Cas9 proteins to facilitate testing 
of split DddAtox variants directed to target DNA half-sites with different 
spacing region lengths22 (Supplementary Table 2). Each DddAtox half was 
fused to the N terminus of dSpCas923 or an orthogonal Staphylococcus 
aureus Cas9 variant (SaKKH-Cas9)24. Each split was assayed in its two 
possible fusion orientations: SaKKH-Cas9 fused either to DddAtox-N 
(‘aureus-N’) or to DddAtox-C (‘aureus-C’) (Fig. 2b, c). The top DNA strand 
of test sites contained more TC motifs than the bottom strand and was 
therefore more likely to be edited by DddAtox (Extended Data Fig. 3). To 
enhance edits at target sites, we used SaKKH-Cas9(D10A) nickase25to 
nick the bottom strand, in order to promote its resynthesis using the 
edited top DNA strand as a template13,14,26,27.
Among active split-DddAtox–Cas9 fusions, we observed C•G-to-T•A 
conversions in the spacing region between the two protospacers 
(Fig. 2d, Extended Data Fig. 3). All editing efficiencies in this study 
report the fraction of sequenced alleles with the desired C•G-to-T•A 
edit among all treated cells with no enrichment. Notably, we observed 
no on-target editing in the absence of guide RNAs or when only one 
DddAtox–Cas9 half and its guide RNA were present (Supplementary 
Table 3), indicating that editing is strictly dependent on the reassembly 
of both DddAtox halves at the Cas9-specified target site.

Among the seven splits tested, splits at G1333 and G1397 yielded 
the highest editing efficiencies of 22%–48% at the most highly edited 
position within the target spacing region (Extended Data Fig. 3b, g, h, 
Supplementary Discussion). For a given fusion orientation, the editing 
efficiencies of target bases were dependent on their positions within 
the spacing region; for example, G1397 aureus-C yielded 20%–22% edit-
ing at a target TC14 (the 14th nucleotide of the spacing region between 
the two target protospacers) within 17- and 23-bp spacing regions, and 
41% within a 44-bp spacing region (Fig. 2d). These results collectively 
suggest that splitting DddAtox at G1333 and G1397 produces halves 
that reconstitute at a target site to mediate C•G-to-T•A conversion 
in human cells. Spacing region length, target cytosine position and 
split orientation are all determinants of the base-editing efficiency 
of split-DddAtox.

Nuclear base editing by TALE–DddAtox

Because DddAtox split at G1333 or G1397 can deaminate target TCs within 
a modest spacing region (Supplementary Discussion), we speculated 
that fusing split DddAtox halves to TALE array proteins that bind neigh-
bouring DNA sites might result in CRISPR-free, RNA-free base editing 
in human cells.

We fused DddAtox halves split at G1333 to TALE array proteins con-
taining a bipartite nuclear localization signal (bpNLS) to bind nuclear 
DNA sequences flanking an 18-bp spacing region within CCR5 in U2OS 
cells (Extended Data Fig. 4a). Compared with simple fusions that do not 
contain a uracil glycosylase inhibitor (UGI), appending two copies of 
UGI (2×-UGI)14,28 to the N terminus increased the editing efficiency at C9 
by approximately 8-fold (to 22%–27%) and reduced indels to less than 
2.3 ± 0.31% (mean ± s.d.). Fusing 2×-UGI to the C terminus through a 2- or 
a 16-amino-acid linker resulted in lower editing efficiencies of 12 ± 3.5% or 
3.3 ± 1.3%, respectively (Extended Data Fig. 4a). These results collectively 
demonstrate that split DddAtox can be fused to TALE arrays to mediate 
C•G-to-T•A conversions in human nuclear DNA, and that fusing UGI to these 
proteins enhances editing efficiencies and reduces indel byproducts14,28.

Mitochondrial base editing by TALE–DddAtox

To apply TALE–split DddAtox fusions for mitochondrial base editing, 
we fused split DddAtox halves to MTS-linked TALE proteins that target 
MT-ND69, a mitochondrial gene that encodes the NADH dehydroge-
nase 6 subunit of complex I (Supplementary Table 4). Among fusions 
that did not contain UGI, we observed the highest level of mtDNA 
target editing (4.9 ± 0.17%) for the architecture that comprised the

C-terminal half of DddAtox split at G1397 and bound to the right TALE 
assembled with the N-terminal half of DddAtox split at G1397 and 
bound to the left TALE (Right–G1397-C + Left–G1397-N; Extended Data  
Fig. 5a, b).
In contrast to nuclear-localized TALE–DddAtox, fusing one or two 
UGI proteins to the N terminus of each mitoTALE–DddAtox half did not 
enhance C•G-to-T•A conversion. Appending one UGI to the C terminus, 
however, increased editing levels by three- to tenfold compared with con-
structs that lacked UGI (up to 16%–27% for C6, C7 and C13 in TC contexts). 
Adding a second copy of UGI to the C terminus did not further increase 
mtDNA editing efficiencies (Fig. 3a). UGI probably inhibits mitochon-
drial UNG1 to enhance editing efficiencies by impeding uracil excision29. 
Removing the MTS sequences or replacing them with a bpNLS was found 
to abrogate editing, demonstrating that MT-ND6 editing is dependent on 
the mitochondrial localization of the mitoTALE–DddAtox fusions (Fig. 3a).
Fluorescence microscopy images revealed that, whereas MTS–
mitoTALE–split-DddAtox–UGI fusions localized to the mitochondria 
in HeLa cells, MTS–UGI–mitoTALE–split-DddAtox fusions remained 
diffused throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 3b). These findings explain 
the observed dependence of editing efficiency on the position of 
UGI fusion and suggest that proximity between the MTS and an 
N-terminal UGI may impede mitochondrial import of the fusion  
protein.
These results collectively suggested the following optimized mito-
TALE–split-DddAtox architecture (in N- to C-terminus order): an MTS, a 

TALE array, a two-amino-acid linker, a DddAtox half from the G1333 or G1397 
split, and one UGI protein (Fig. 3c). This architecture, hereafter referred 
to as DddA-derived cytosine base editor (DdCBE), represents—to our 
knowledge—the first agent that is capable of performing precise genome 
editing in mtDNA. The application of DdCBE contrasts with previously 
reported uses of nucleases to make double-strand breaks in mtDNA, which 
result in the loss of targeted mtDNA copies and in heteroplasmic shifts8–10.
Given that DddAtox can edit cytosines on either DNA strand, inter-
mediates that contain uracils on opposing DNA strands could produce 
double-strand breaks during DNA repair, causing unwanted indels. 
Although the standard cytosine base editor BE4max30—when targeted 
to EMX1 in the nucleus—resulted in 1.8 ± 0.67% indels in HEK293T cells, 
indels were not detected (less than 0.1%) at MT-ND6 despite DdCBE edit-
ing both mtDNA strands (Fig. 3c, Extended Data Fig. 4b, c). Indeed, we 
observed very high product purities (at least 99.5%) for DdCBE-mediated 
mtDNA base editing of MT-ND6 in HEK293T cells and in U2OS cells—
exceeding the product purities resulting from the editing of CCR5 by 
nuclear-targeted BE4max (96 ± 0.78%) and by nuclear-targeted DdCBE 
(95 ± 0.52%) (Fig. 3d, Extended Data Fig. 4d). These results suggest that 
the DNA repair processes that lead to indels and other byproducts in 
nuclear DNA19 are inefficient in mitochondria (Supplementary Discus-
sion; see Fig. 3e for MT-ND6 allele frequencies in HEK293T cells after 
treatment with MT-ND6-DdCBE, denoted as ND6-DdCBE). Instead, 
lesion-containing mtDNA is degraded rather than repaired11, resulting 
in the selective maintenance of cleanly edited mtDNA copies.

These findings establish a precision mtDNA editing platform, which 
uses a dsDNA-specific cytidine deaminase that is split to mitigate toxicity, 
programmable dsDNA-binding TALE arrays localized to the mitochon-
dria, and a UGI to achieve RNA-free base editing in the mitochondria.

Base editing of five mtDNA genes

To explore the generality of DdCBE for mtDNA editing, we engineered or 
adapted seven pairs of TALE arrays (Supplementary Table 4) to target five 
mitochondrial genes: MT-ND1, MT-ND2, MT-ND4, MT-ND5 and MT-ATP8.
Three to six days after treatment, mitochondrial base-editing effi-
ciencies of DdCBEs in HEK293T cells varied between 4.6% and 49% 
depending on the split type, split orientation and target cytosine posi-
tion within the spacing region. For DdCBEs using the G1333 split, the 
Right–G1333-C + Left–G1333-N orientation resulted in 2.1- to 15-fold 
higher editing efficiencies than the Right–G1333-N + Left–G1333-C 
orientation, regardless of the spacing length and positions of TC tar-
get bases (Fig. 4a–e, g). By contrast, the effect of split orientation on 
editing efficiencies was more site-dependent for G1397 (Fig. 4b, d–f ).
Collectively, optimized G1397-split DdCBEs mediated average 
base-editing efficiencies of 42% at each of four well-edited mtDNA sites 
(Fig. 4a–c, e) and average efficiencies of 9.0% at two modestly edited 
sites (Fig. 4d, f ), whereas the most efficient G1333-split DdCBEs yielded 
43% average conversion at three sites (Fig. 4a–c) and 7.4% average effi-
ciencies at three other sites (Fig. 4d, e, g). We did not detect indels or 
base editing outside the spacing region (Supplementary Tables 5, 6).
Within 14–18-bp spacing regions, G1397-split DdCBE preferen-
tially edited TCs that were positioned approximately 4–7 nucleotides 
upstream of the 3′ end of the spacing region in either mtDNA strand. By

contrast, G1333-split DdCBE preferentially edited TCs that were posi-
tioned approximately 4–10 nucleotides from the 5′ end of the spacing 
region in either mtDNA strand (Fig. 4h). These results indicate that each 
split edits TCs with a preference for specific windows in the spacing 
region. For a given target sequence, we recommend testing G1397 and 
G1333 splits in both orientations, using spacing lengths and TALE-binding 
sites guided by the above principles (Supplementary Discussion).
We confirmed the durability of mtDNA edits in HEK293T cells over 18 
days (Extended Data Fig. 6a–d, Supplementary Discussion). In addition, 
mtDNA editing did not reduce cell viability, produced no large mtDNA 
deletions, and did not perturb mtDNA copy numbers (Extended Data 
Fig. 6g–i, Supplementary Discussion). We observed a substantial reduc-
tion in editing when mtDNA replication was blocked by induced expres-
sion of a dominant negative mitochondrial polymerase gamma mutant31 
(Extended Data Fig. 7). We speculate that during mtDNA replication, repli-
cative polymerases incorporate A opposite U to resolve the U•G intermedi-
ate into a T•A base pair. DdCBE-mediated mtDNA editing in non-dividing 
cells should be feasible because mtDNA replication proceeds even in 
post-mitotic cells32. Indeed, untransformed primary human fibroblasts 
also supported efficient mtDNA base editing (typically 30%–40%) (Fig. 4i) 
despite dividing much less frequently than HEK293T cells, indicating that 
the use of DdCBE is not limited to immortalized cell lines.
Given that mutations in mtDNA genes that encode complex I subunits 
are thought to be pathogenic in rare tumours of the thyroid and kidney6,33, 
we investigated the consequences of editing MT-ND4 in cells containing 
the m.11922G>A mutation (for the characterization of other edited sites, 
see Extended Data Fig. 8c–f and Supplementary Discussion). Compared 
with control cells treated with catalytically inactive DdCBE, cells treated 
with ND4-DdCBE had lower rates of oxidative phosphorylation (Fig. 4j) 
and decreased basal and uncoupled respiration rates (Fig. 4k)—consistent 
with the disruption of complex I. Mitochondrial DNA homeostasis and 
associated transcripts were unchanged (Extended Data Fig. 8a, b). Also 
consistent with a specific defect in complex I, the enzymatic activity and 
assembly of complex I—but not of complex IV—were markedly reduced 
in these cells (Fig. 4l, m). These results establish that precise DdCBE 
editing can be applied to study mitochondrial phenotypes arising from 
disease-associated mtDNA mutations.

Off-target editing by DdCBEs

To profile the off-target activity of DdCBE in the human mitochondrial 
genome, we transfected HEK293T cells with plasmids that constitutively 
expressed optimized DdCBE or the corresponding dead-DdCBE con-
trol in order to distinguish DdCBE-induced single-nucleotide variants 
(SNVs) from background heteroplasmy. To test for possible editing 
arising as a result of the spontaneous assembly of split DddAtox in the 
absence of TALE-directed DNA binding, cells were also transfected with 
plasmids expressing MTS–G1397 split–UGI, with no TALE array (Fig. 5a).
The average frequencies of mitochondrial genome-wide off-target 
C•G-to-T•A editing by MTND5P2-DdCBE (denoted as ND5.2-DdCBE), 
ND4-DdCBE and ATP8-DdCBE (0.030%–0.034%) were similar to those 
of the untreated and dead-DdCBE controls (0.024%–0.030%), whereas 
MTND5P1-DdCBE (denoted as ND5.1-DdCBE) had a 1.6-fold higher aver-
age off-target editing frequency (0.049%) compared with the untreated 
control (Fig. 5b). We attribute the unusually high average off-target 
editing frequency by ND6-DdCBE (0.13%) to the permissive mutant 
N-terminal domain (NTD) of TALE (Fig. 3a), which may increase the 
non-specific binding of TALE arrays. Off-target mutations from the 
spontaneous reassembly of TALE-free split DddAtox were not detected 
at greater levels than in untreated cells (Fig. 5b). Notably, we did not 
observe significant off-target editing at nuclear pseudogenes, even 
though they differ by only 1–2 bp from the mtDNA on-target sites 
(Extended Data Fig. 9).
DdCBEs with standard NTDs generally exhibited 150- to 860-fold 
higher on-target editing relative to off-target editing, with no strong 

correlation between on-target editing efficiencies and off-target activ-
ity (Supplementary Table 8). Because all of these standard DdCBEs 
exhibit similar protein expression levels (Extended Data Fig. 6f ) and 
share wild-type NTDs and deaminase domains but have different TALE 
repeats, we conclude that TALE domains influence off-target activity. 
Moreover, TALE–split DddA fusions must be positioned in close prox-
imity for both on-target and off-target editing (Extended Data Fig. 10).
To further investigate the nature of off-target edits (see Extended 
Data Fig. 11 for predicted effect of off-target SNVs on protein function), 
we searched the 20-bp regions flanking each off-target SNV for any 
sequence homology to the on-target TALE-binding sites. Although we 
noted a strong 5′-TC-3′ preference for ND6-DdCBE and ND5.1-DdCBE 
off-target edits that matches the sequence preference for free DddAtox 
in E. coli (Fig. 1i, Supplementary Discussion), we did not observe any 
consensus off-target sequences that closely resemble on-target TALE 
binding sites (Fig. 5c). In addition, up to 20%–80% of SNVs identified 
for each DdCBE overlapped with those of other DdCBEs containing 
distinct TALE arrays programmed to bind different on-target sites 
(Supplementary Data 2, Supplementary Table 9). Collectively, these 
results suggest that off-target editing does not arise from editing at 
sequences similar to on-target sites. Instead, we speculate that DdCBE 
halves containing TALE arrays with greater non-specific DNA binding 
activity34 are more likely to bind proximally to transiently reassemble 
active DddAtox, which can then engage off-target mtDNA regions with 
no necessary homology to the on-target site.

Discussion

This study describes an interbacterial cytidine deaminase toxin specific for 
dsDNA, and its development into a CRISPR-free, RNA-free base editor that 
can install targeted mutations in the human mitochondrial genome with 
typical efficiencies ranging between 5% and 50%. The resulting DdCBEs 
enable programmable C•G-to-T•A conversions in mtDNA without requiring 
double-strand breaks, a capability that has the potential to model mito-
chondrial disease mutations, correct pathogenic variants (Supplementary 
Table 10) and expand our knowledge of mitochondrial biology.
Additional research will be needed to fully elucidate the principles 
that govern the efficiency and specificity of DdCBE. Developing in vitro 
and in vivo strategies to deliver DdCBEs will be essential for exploring 
their therapeutic potential in other cell types and in animal models 
of mitochondrial diseases. Exploring additional sources of natural 
diversity among bacterial DNA deaminases, or engineering DddA-
tox variants with altered sequence context and substrate preferences 
beyond 5′-TC-3′, would further expand the scope of mtDNA editing. 
Finally, although this study has focused on the use of DdCBE for mito-
chondrial base editing, some features of DdCBE (or zinc-finger array 
variants35)—such as its all-protein composition, its lack of requirement 
for a protospacer adjacent motif, and its independence from CRISPR 
components—may also offer advantages for base editing in cells and 
organelles beyond mitochondria.

Methods

No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. The 
experiments were not randomized and the investigators were not 
blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment.

Bacterial strains and culture conditions
Unless otherwise noted, all bacterial strains used in this study were 
grown in Lysogeny Broth (LB) at 37 °C or on LB medium solidified with 
agar (LBA, 1.5% w/v, except as noted). When required, media was sup-
plemented with the following: carbenicillin (150 μg ml−1) gentamycin (15 
μg ml−1), IPTG (80 μM, except as noted), rhamnose (0.05% w/v, except 
as noted), chloramphenicol (10 μg ml−1) or tetracycline (20 μg ml−1 for 
E. coli, 120 μg ml−1 for B. cenocepacia). E. coli strains DH5α, XK1502 and 
BL21 were used for plasmid maintenance, toxicity and mutagenesis 
assays, and protein expression, respectively. B. cenocepacia strains 
were derived from the cystic fibrosis clinical isolate H111. A detailed 
description of the bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study is 
provided in Supplementary Table 11.

Genetic techniques and plasmid construction for bacterial 
expression
All procedures for DNA manipulation and transformation were per-
formed with standard methods. Molecular biology reagents, Phusion 
high fidelity DNA polymerase, restriction enzymes, and Gibson Assem-
bly Reagent were obtained from New England Biolabs (NEB). GoTaq 
Green Master Mix was obtained from Promega. Primers and gBlocks 
used in this study were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies 
(IDT). A list of all primers used in bacterial studies is provided in Sup-
plementary Table 12.
Protein expression constructs were generated by Gibson assembly. 
The toxin domain of DddA was identified by remote homology with 
characterized deaminase domains identified through HMMER36. For 
functional protein expression assays of DddAtox, TadA and CDD, the 
relevant genes or gene fragments were amplified from B. cenocepacia 
(DddAtox) or E. coli genomic DNA and cloned into the vector pSCRhaB2. 
The gene encoding DddIA was amplified from B. cenocepacia and cloned 
into pPSV39, and the expression construct for DddAtox(E1347A) was 
generated by overlap extension PCR followed by Gibson assembly 
with pSCRhaB2. For the APOBEC3G expression construct, the gene 
sequence was codon optimized for expression in E. coli, generated by 
synthesis as a gBLOCK (IDT) and cloned into pSCRhaB2. For protein 
purification, genes encoding DddAtox and DddAI were amplified from 
B. cenocepacia and cloned into pETDuet.
In-frame gene deletions and nucleotide substitutions in B. ceno-
cepacia were performed by homologous recombination using the 
plasmid pDONRPEX18Tp-SceI-pheS, followed by counter-selection 
using the plasmid pDAI-SceI and plasmid curing using 0.1% (w/v) 
p-chlorophenylalanine, as described previously37. B. cenocepacia 
contains two complete T6SSs38 and both were inactivated (∆icmF1, 
I35_RS01770; ∆icmF2, I35_RS17395) and tested in this study. The 
∆icmF2 mutation did not influence DddA-dependent intercellular 
intoxication and is thus not included in Fig. 1b for the sake of brev-
ity. Gentamycin-resistant B. cenocepacia was generated by insertion 
of a resistance cassette at the Tn7 site attachment site as described 
previously39.

Plasmid construction for mammalian expression
PCR was performed using Phusion U Green Multiplex PCR Master Mix 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific), Phusion U Green Hot Start DNA Polymerase 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) or Q5 Hot Start High-Fidelity DNA Polymer-
ase (New England Biolabs). All plasmids were constructed using USER 
cloning (New England Biolabs). DddAtox and mitoTALE genes were syn-
thesized as gene blocks and codon optimized for human expression 
(Genscript). BE4max was obtained according to a previous report30. 

BE2max (rAPOBEC1–dSpCas9–UGI–UGI) was cloned from a BE4max 
plasmid. Compared with BE214, BE2max contains an extra UGI protein 
and uses codon optimization from BE4max. DddAtox–Cas9 fusions and 
DdCBE variants were cloned into pCMV (mammalian codon-optimized) 
backbones. sgRNA plasmids were constructed by blunt-end ligation of 
a linear polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product generated by encod-
ing the 20- to 23-nt variable protospacer sequence onto the 5′ end of an 
amplification primer and treating the resulting piece with KLD Enzyme 
Mix (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 
Mach1 chemically competent E. coli cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific) 
were used for plasmid construction. E. coli strain DH5α:dddI was used to 
construct intact DddAtox–Cas9 plasmids. Plasmids for mammalian trans-
fection were purified using ZymoPURE II Plasmid Midiprep Kits (Zymo 
Research), as previously described40. A list of all primers used in mam-
malian expression constructs is provided in Supplementary Table 13.

Bacterial competition experiments
Bacterial competition experiments were used to evaluate the fitness of 
B. cenocepacia strains in interbacterial interactions. Donor and recipi-
ent strains were grown overnight and mixed in a 10:1 (v/v) ratio for donor 
and recipient, respectively. Cell suspensions were then concentrated to 
a total optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 10, and 10 μl was spotted on a 
0.2 μm nitrocellulose membrane placed on LBA (3% w/v) and incubated 
for 6 h at 37 °C. After incubation, cells were scraped from the membrane 
surface and resuspended in 1 ml LB. The initial donor:recipient ratio 
and the post-incubation ratio were determined by plating on LB agar 
(LBA) to determine the total number of colony forming units (cfu) and 
on LBA with gentamycin to quantify cfu of the recipient strain.

Toxicity assays
To evaluate the toxicity of deaminases expressed heterologously, over-
night cultures of E. coli XK1502 containing the appropriate plasmids 
were diluted 1:1,000 into fresh medium and grown until they reached 
exponential phase (OD600 0.6), at which point deaminase expression 
was induced with rhamnose (0.2% w/v). Aliquots of cultures were then 
collected periodically until 480 min of growth and were diluted and 
plated onto LBA for c.f.u determination.

Crystallization and structure determination
Crystals of the selenomethionine derivative hexahistidine-tagged 
DddAtox (aa 1264–1427)·DddIA complex were obtained at 5–10 mg 
ml−1 in crystallization buffer (15 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1.0 mM 
tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP)), mixed 1:1 with crystallization 
solution containing 25% (w/v) PEG 3350, 0.1 M Bis-Tris:HCl pH 6.5,  
200 mM MgCl2. Rectangular crystals grew to 400 × 200 × 100 μm over  
5 days. Selenomethionine DddAtox·DddIA crystals displayed the 
symmetry of space group P21212 (a = 126.8 Å, b = 145.0 Å, c = 64.2 Å, 
α = β = γ = 90°), with four dimers in the asymmetric unit. Before data 
collection, crystals were cryoprotected in crystallization solution  
(15% glycerol, 25% PEG3350, 100 mM MgCl2, 100 mM NaCl, 7.5 mM Tris 
pH 7.5, 50 mM Bis-Tris pH 6.5, 0.5 mM TCEP).
Highly redundant anomalous (SAD) data were obtained at 0.9790 Å  
(peak) wavelength from a single selenomethionine crystal at 100 K 
temperature at the BL502 beamline (ALS, Lawrence Berkeley National 
Laboratory). Data were processed using HKL200041. Heavy-atom 
searching using phenix.autosol identified 18 possible sites, and refine-
ment yielded an estimated Bayes correlation coefficient of 55.9 to 2.5 Å 
resolution. After density modification, the estimated Bayes correlation 
coefficient increased to 61.2. Approximately 70% of the selenomethio-
nine model was constructed automatically, and the remaining portion 
was built manually. The current model (Supplementary Table 1) con-
tains four DddA·DddIA dimers.
Refinement was carried out against peak anomalous data with 
Bijvoet pairs kept separate using phenix.refine42 interspersed with 
manual model revisions using the program Coot43 and consisted of 

conjugate-gradient minimization and calculation of individual atomic 
displacement and translation/libration/screw parameters44. Residues 
that could not be identified in the electron density were: 1250–1289 and 
1423–1427 for DddA, and 71–73 for DddIA. Both models exhibit excel-
lent geometry, as determined by MolProbity45. Ramachandran analysis 
identified 99.1% favoured, 0.9% allowed and 0% disallowed residues 
for the model. Coordinates and structure factors are deposited in the 
RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB ID: 6U08).

Mutation frequency determination and SNP generation assay
To determine the frequency of mutations induced by expression of 
DddAtox and DddAtox(E1347A), overnight cultures of E. coli containing 
the expression plasmids for these proteins together with the plasmid 
for expression of DddIA were diluted 1:1,000 into fresh medium and 
grown until they reached the exponential phase (OD600 0.6). The cul-
tures were then induced with IPTG (80 μM) for DddIA and rhamnose 
(0.04% w/v) for DddAtox or DddAtox(E1347A) expression. The combined 
expression of both toxin and immunity proteins at this low level ena-
bles the cells expressing DddAtox to suffer growth arrest but does not 
result in a decrease in culture viability. After 1 h under these inducing 
conditions, cultures were supplemented with 1 mM of IPTG to increase 
DddIA expression and thus block DddA toxicity and were then grown 
for an additional 16 h. After this recovery period, the cultures were 
plated onto LBA containing rifampicin (100 μg ml−1) or no antibiotics. 
Mutation frequency was determined dividing the number of rifampicin 
resistant colonies by the total c.f.u obtained on non-selective medium.
For the genome-wide identification of SNPs that accumulate after low 
level expression of DddAtox or DddAtox(E1347A), E. coli Δudg strain car-
rying plasmids for expression of one of these proteins plus the plasmid 
for expressing DddIA was submitted to seven rounds of expression and 
recovery as described above, with cultures being plated after recovery 
and single colonies being selected and used to inoculate the subsequent 
round of expression. Randomly chosen single colonies were used to 
avoid introducing selection for increased fitness under the culture 
conditions46. Five isolated colonies from each starting population 
subjected to this regimen were selected for whole genome sequenc-
ing. We confirmed the presence of non-mutagenized DddAtox and 
DddAtox(E1347A) in these sequencing data.

Western blot for deaminase expression in E. coli
Western blotting to detect deaminases expressed in E. coli was per-
formed using rabbit anti-VSV-G (diluted 1:5,000, Sigma) and detected 
with anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary anti-
bodies (diluted 1:5,000, Sigma). Loading control was performed with 
mouse anti-RNAP (diluted 1:500, BioLegend) and detected with sheep 
anti-mouse (diluted 1:500, Millipore). Western blots were developed 
using chemiluminescent substrate (SuperSignal West Pico Substrate, 
Thermo Scientific) and imaged with a C600 imager (Azure Biosystems).

Western blot for deaminase expression in mammalian cells
HEK293T cells were transfected as described below. For preparation of 
cell lysate for western blot analysis of DdCBE, cells were lysed in 150 μl 
of ice-cold 1x RIPA buffer (Sigma) with added protease inhibitor (Roche 
Complete Mini) by incubating for 30 min at 4 °C with agitation. Lysates 
were cleared by pelleting at 12,000g for 10 min at 4 °C.
Next, 60 μl of cleared lysate supernatant was added to 20 μl of 4X 
LDS sample loading buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with a final DTT 
(Sigma Aldrich) concentration of 10 mM. Lysates were boiled for 10 
min at 95 °C. Then 15–20 μl of protein lysate was loaded into the wells 
of a Bolt 4–12% Bis-Tris Plus (Thermo Fisher Scientific) pre-cast gel. 6 μl  
of Precision Plus Protein Dual Colour Standard (Bio-Rad) was used as 
a reference. Samples were separated by electrophoresis at 180 V for  
45 min in Bolt MES SDS running buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Trans-
fer to a PVDF membrane was performed using an iBlot 2 Gel Transfer 
Device (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s 

protocols. The membrane was blocked in Odyssey Blocking Buffer 
(LI-COR) for 1 h at room temperature, then incubated with rat anti-Flag 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific MA1-142; 1:2,000 dilution), mouse anti-HA 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific 26183; 1:2,000 dilution) and rabbit anti-actin 
(CST 4970; 1:2,000 dilution) in blocking buffer (0.5% Tween-20 in 1x 
PBS, 0.2 μm filtered) overnight at 4 °C. The membrane was washed 
three times with TBST (1x TBS in 0.5% Tween-20, 0.2-μm filtered) for 
10 min each at room temperature, then incubated with IRDye-labelled 
secondary antibodies goat anti-rat 680RD (LI-COR 926-68076), goat 
anti-mouse 800CW (LI-COR 926-32210) and donkey anti-rabbit 800CW 
(LI-COR 926–32213) diluted 1:5,000 in blocking buffer for 1 h at room 
temperature. The membrane was washed as before, then imaged using 
an Odyssey Imaging System (LI-COR).

Mitochondria isolation and blue-native-PAGE analysis
Mitochondria isolation was performed as described47. Cells were col-
lected from the plates by pipetting in NKM buffer (1 mM Tris–HCl,  
pH 7.4, 130 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 7.5 mM MgCl2) followed by centrifu-
gation at 400g at 4 °C for 8 min. Pellets were resuspended in ice-cold 
0.1x homogenization buffer (4 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 2.5 mM NaCl, 
0.5 mM MgCl2) and incubated for 5 min on ice. Twenty strokes of a 
tight-fitting pestle (Dounce homogenizer) were applied to homog-
enize cells and buffer was adjusted to isotonic conditions by addition of 
one-ninth volume of 10x homogenization buffer. Cell debris and nuclei 
were pelleted by two succeeding centrifugations at 900g at 4 °C for  
4 min and mitochondria were collected by centrifugation at 10,000g at 
4 °C for 2 min. Then 50 μg of mitochondria were suspended in Native-
PAGE solubilization buffer (Thermo Fisher) with addition of digitonin 
at a ratio of 4 g digitonin per g protein and incubated on ice for 10 min. 
Samples were centrifuged 16,000g at 4 °C for 10 min, supernatants were 
collected to new tubes and NativePAGE G-250 Sample Additive (Thermo 
Fisher) was added to each sample to a final concentration of 0.25%. 
Samples were loaded onto NativePAGE 3–12% Bis-Tris Gels (Thermo 
Fisher) and electrophoresis was performed with the use of NativePAGE 
Running Buffer system (Thermo Fisher) at constant 150 V for 45 min 
at 4 °C followed by 250 V for 90 min at room temperature. After initial 
45 min electrophoresis, the Dark Blue Cathode Buffer was replaced 
with the Light Blue Cathode Buffer. After electrophoresis, transfer 
to a PVDF membrane (BioRad) was performed using semi-dry Trans 
Blot Turbo transfer system (BioRad). Membranes were incubated for 
5 min in 8% v/v acetic acid and washed briefly with methanol following 
5 min incubation in distilled H2O. Membranes were washed twice with 
TBST (TBS-Tween-20, Boston BioProducts) and blocked with 5% w/v 
Blotting-Grade Blocker (BioRad) in TBST. Membranes were incubated 
with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C (mouse anti-NDUFA9, Abcam 
14713, 1:1,000 dilution; rabbit anti-UQCRC2, Abcam 103616, 1:1,000 
dilution; mouse anti-ATP5A, Abcam 14748, 1:6,000 dilution; mouse 
anti-MTCO2, Abcam 110258, 1:1,000 dilution; mouse anti-SDHB, Abcam 
14714, 1:1,000 dilution). Membranes were washed 3 times for 10 min 
with TBST and incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 h at room tem-
perature followed by washing 3 times for 10 min with TBST. Membranes 
were incubated with Western Lightning Plus-ECL (PerkinElmer) and 
signal was registered on the Amersham Hyperfilm high performance 
autoradiography film (GE Healthcare). Films were scanned and 8-bit 
greyscale files were used for quantification with Fiji software48. For 
each image, a region of interest of the same size was used to quantify 
all bands and their corresponding background signals. Obtained values 
were inverted so that white pixels = 0 and black pixels = 255. Net values 
were calculated as a difference between band values and background 
values. Obtained net values were used to calculate the protein ratio of 
ND4-DdCBE-treated cells relative to mock-edited cells.

Purification of proteins for bacterial biochemical assays
Overnight cultures of E. coli BL21 pETDuet-1::dddAtox-dddIA, or E. coli 
BL21 pETDuet-1::dddAtox(E1347A) were used to inoculate 2 l of LB broth 

in a 1:100 dilution and cultures were grown to approximately OD600 0.6. 
At this point, plasmid expression was induced with 0.5 mM IPTG and 
the cultures were incubated for 16 h at 18 °C in a shaking incubator. Cell 
pellets were collected by centrifugation at 4,000g for 20 min, followed 
by resuspension in 50 ml of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 500 mM 
NaCl, 30 mM imidazole, 1 mM DTT, and 1 mg ml−1 lysozyme). Cell pellets 
were then lysed by sonication (5 pulses, 10 s each) and supernatant was 
separated by centrifugation at 25,000g for 30 min.
The DddAtox–DddIA complex or DddAtox(E1347A) was purified from cell 
lysates by nickel affinity chromatography using 4 ml of Ni-NTA agarose 
beads loaded onto a gravity-flow column. The supernatant was loaded 
onto the column and resin was washed with 50 ml of wash buffer (50 mM  
Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 30 mM imidazole, 1 mM DTT). Pro-
teins of interest were eluted with 5 ml elution buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl  
pH 7.5, 300 mM imidazole, 500 mM NaCl, 30 mM imidazole, 1 mM DTT). 
When DddAtox(E1347A) was purified, the eluted samples were applied 
directly to size-exclusion chromatography. For DddA–DddIA, the eluted 
samples underwent a denaturation and renaturation step to isolate only 
the toxin. In this case, the eluted proteins were added to 50 ml 8 M urea 
denaturing buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 300 mM imidazole, 500 mM 
NaCl and 1 mM DTT) and incubated for 16 h at 4 °C. The 8 M urea denatur-
ing buffer with the eluted proteins was loaded on a gravity-flow column 
with 4 ml Ni-NTA agarose beads. The column was washed with 50 ml 8 M 
urea denaturing buffer to remove any remaining DddIA. While still bound 
to Ni-NTA agarose beads, DddAtox was renatured by sequential washes 
with 25 ml denaturing buffer with decreasing concentrations of urea  
(6 M, 4 M, 2 M, 1 M), and a last wash with wash buffer to remove remaining 
traces of urea. Proteins bound to the column were then eluted with 5 ml 
elution buffer. The eluted samples were purified again by size-exclusion 
chromatography using fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) with 
gel filtration on a Superdex200 column (GE Healthcare) in sizing buffer 
(20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 5% (w/v) glycerol). The 
fraction purity was evaluated by SDS–PAGE gel stained with Coomassie 
blue and the highest quality factions were stored at −80 °C.

DNA deamination assays
All the DNA substrates were purchased from IDT, and a 6-FAM fluoro-
phore was added for visualization (see Supplementary Table 12 for 
substrate sequences). Reactions were performed in 10 μl of deamina-
tion buffer (20 mM MES pH 6.4, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 8% Ficoll 70 
and 1 μM substrate) with APOBEC3A, DddAtox or DddAtox(E1347A) at the 
concentrations indicated in Fig. 1f, g and Extended Data Fig. 1d. Reac-
tions were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, followed by the addition of 5 μl of 
UDG solution (New England Biolabs, 0.02 U μl−1 UDG in 1X UDG buffer) 
and further incubated for 30 min. Cleavage of substrates was induced 
by addition of 100 mM NaOH and incubation at 95 °C for 3 min. Samples 
were analysed by denaturing 15% acrylamide gel electrophoresis and 
the resulting fluorescent DNA fragments were detected by fluorescence 
imaging with Azure Biosystems.

Poisoned primer extension assay for RNA deamination
All substrate sequences are listed in Supplementary Table 12. The RNA 
substrates and the oligonucleotide containing a 5′ 6-FAM fluorophore 
for visualization were purchased from IDT. Deamination reactions were 
performed in 10 μl of RNA deamination buffer (Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 200 mM 
NaCl, 1 mM DTT) with the addition of 1 μM of DddAtox or DddAtox(E1347A). 
Substrate combinations and concentrations were added as indicated in 
Extended Data Fig. 1e, f, and reactions were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. 
cDNA synthesis was performed in a 10-μl reaction (2.5 U μl−1 MultiScribe 
Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Fisher), 1 μl deamination reaction,  
1.5 μM oligonucleotide, 100 μM dATP, 100 μM dCTP, 100 μM dTTP, and 
100 μM ddGTP). The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min and 
samples were analysed by denaturing 15% acrylamide gel electropho-
resis. The synthesized cDNA fragments were detected by fluorescence 
imaging with a C600 (Azure Biosystems).

Genome sequencing and SNP identification in bacteria
Overnight cultures from isolated colonies were used for total gDNA 
extraction with the DNeasy Blood & Tissue kit (Qiagen), and extraction 
yield was quantified using a Qubit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Sequenc-
ing libraries were constructed using the Nextera DNA Flex Library Prep 
Kit (Illumina). Library quality and concentration was evaluated with a 
Qubit and TapeStation System (Agilent). Sequencing was performed 
with an Illumina MiSeq instrument (300 cycles paired end program). 
Genome mapping was performed with BWA49 using the E. coli MG1655 
(NC_000913.3) genome as a reference. Pileup data from alignments 
were generated with SAMtools and variant calling was performed with 
VarScan250. SNPs were considered valid if they were present at a fre-
quency greater than 90%.

Mammalian cell culture
All cells were cultured and maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Anti-
biotics were not used for cell culture of HEK293T cells, U2OS cells, 
T-Rex-293-based POLGdn cells and primary fibroblasts. HEK293T cells 
(CRL-3216, American Type Culture Collection (ATCC)) were cultured in 
DMEM with GlutaMax (Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 
10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Gibco). U2OS cells (HTB-96, ATCC) were 
cultured in McCoy’s 5A medium with GlutaMax (Thermo Fisher Scien-
tific) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Gibco). HeLa 
cells (ATCC CCL-2) were cultured in high glucose DMEM (Gibco) with 
10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biological), and 100 U ml−1 penicillin 
(Sigma-Aldrich). Primary human fibroblasts (GM04541, Coriell) were 
cultured in DMEM with GlutaMAX supplemented with 20% (v/v) FBS 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific). T-Rex-293-based POLGdn cells31 were cul-
tured in DMEM with GlutaMax (Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented 
with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Gibco), 1 mM sodium pyruvate and  
50 μg ml−1 uridine (Sigma-Aldrich). Cell lines were authenticated by 
their respective suppliers and tested negative for mycoplasma.

HEK293T and T-Rex-293-based POLGdn mammalian cell 
lipofection
Cells were seeded on 48-well collagen-coated plates (Corning) at a den-
sity of 2 × 105 cells per ml (250 μl total per well), 18–24 h before lipofec-
tion. Lipofection was performed at a cell density of approximately 70%. 
For split DddAtox–Cas9 screening, cells were transfected with 375 ng  
of split DddAtox–dSpCas9 monomer expression plasmid, 375 ng of split 
DddAtox–SaKKH-Cas9(D10A) monomer expression plasmid, 125 ng of 
SpCas9 guide RNA (gRNA) expression plasmid and 125 ng of SaKKH 
gRNA plasmid. pUC19 was used as a filler DNA for monomer and 
no-gRNA control experiments to make up to 1,000 ng of total plasmid 
DNA. For DdCBE experiments, cells were transfected with 500 ng of 
each mitoTALE monomer to make up 1,000 ng of total plasmid DNA. 
Lipofectamine 2000 (1.5 μl, Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used per 
well. Cells were collected at the indicated time point.
For western blot analysis of DdCBEs expressed in mammalian cells, 
HEK293T cells were seeded on 6-well tissue culture-treated plates 
(Corning) at a density of 2 × 105 cells per ml (2 ml total per well), 18–24 h  
before lipofection. Cells were transfected with 4,000 ng of each 
mitoTALE monomer to make up 8,000 ng of total plasmid DNA. Lipo-
fectamine 2000 (12 μl; ThermoFisher Scientific) was used per well. 
Cells were collected at the indicated time point.

U2OS cell plasmid nucleofection
We combined 500 ng of Left DdCBE monomer and 500 ng of Right 
DdCBE monomer in a volume that did not exceed 2 μl. This combined 
plasmid mixture was nucleofected in a final volume of 22 μl per sample 
in a 16-well Nucleocuvette strip (Lonza). U2OS cells were nucleofected 
using the SE Cell Line 4D-Nucleofector X Kit (Lonza) with 30,000–
50,000 cells per sample (program DN-100), according to the manu-
facturer’s protocol.

Cas9 mRNA in vitro transcription
A DNA fragment containing a T7 promoter driving expression of 
polyadenylated Cas9 transcript was isolated from purified plasmid 
(5 μg) using SpeI-HF restriction digestion (New England Biolabs) and 
purified with the MinElute PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen). mRNA was 
transcribed using the HiScribe T7 ARCA mRNA Kit (NEB) and purified 
using MEGAclear Transcription Clean-up kit (Thermo Fisher) according 
to the manufacturer’s instructions and stored at −80 °C.

Human primary fibroblast nucleofection
Human primary fibroblasts were nucleofected as previously described51. 
In brief, 500 ng of in vitro-transcribed Left-DdCBE mRNA and 500 ng of 
in vitro-transcribed Right-DdCBE mRNA were combined in a volume 
that did not exceed 2 μl. This combined mRNA mixture was nucleo-
fected in a final volume of 22 μl per sample in a 16-well Nucleocuvette 
strip (Lonza). Human primary fibroblasts (GM04541, Coriell) were 
nucleofected using the P2 Primary Cell 4D-Nucleofector kit (Lonza) 
with 2.5 × 105 cells per sample (program DS-150), according to the manu-
facturer’s protocol. The medium was changed after 24 h of nucleofec-
tion and cultured for 5 days before collection for high-throughput 
sequencing.

Cell viability assays
Cell viability was measured every 3 to 6 days over an 18-day time 
course using the CellTiter-Glo 2.0 assay (Promega) according to the 
manufacturer’s protocol. Luminescence was measured in 96-well flat 
black-bottomed polystyrene microplates (Corning) using a M1000 Pro 
microplate reader (Tecan) with a 1-s integration time.

Genomic DNA isolation from mammalian cell culture
Medium was removed, and cells were washed once with 1× Dulbecco’s 
phosphate-buffered saline (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Genomic DNA 
extraction was performed by addition of 40 μl freshly prepared lysis 
buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.05% SDS, and proteinase K (20 μg ml−1;  
Thermo Fisher Scientific)) directly into the 48-well culture well. The 
extraction solution was incubated at 37 °C for 60 min and then 80 °C for 
20 min. The resulting genomic DNA was subjected to bead cleanup with 
AMPure DNAdvance beads according to the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions (Beckman Coulter A48705).
For DNA isolation and Sanger sequencing of ND4-edited cells, total 
DNA was extracted from cells with the use of DNeasy Blood & Tissue 
Kit (Qiagen). The ND4 gene fragment spanning the edited m.11922 site 
was amplified with the use of AccuPrime Taq DNA Polymerase System 
(Thermo Fisher). Primers used for the PCR are listed in Supplementary 
Table 13. PCR reaction products were purified by gel extraction with the 
use of QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen) and subjected to Sanger 
sequencing at Genwiz.

High-throughput DNA sequencing of genomic DNA samples
Genomic sites of interest were amplified from genomic DNA samples 
and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq as previously described with the 
following modifications52. Amplification primers containing Illumina 
forward and reverse adapters (Supplementary Table 13) were used for 
a first round of PCR (PCR 1) to amplify the genomic region of interest. 
In brief, 1 μl of purified genomic DNA was used as input into the first 
round of PCR (PCR1). For PCR1, DNA was amplified to the top of the 
linear range using Phusion Hot Start II High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific), according to the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions but with the addition of 0.5x SYBR Green Nucleic Acid Gel Stain 
(Lonza) in each 25-μl reaction. For all amplicons, the PCR1 protocol 
used was an initial heating step of 2 min at 98 °C followed by an opti-
mized number of amplification cycles (10 s at 98 °C, 20 s at 62 °C, 30 s 
at 72 °C). Quantitative PCR was performed to determine the optimal 
cycle number for each amplicon. The number of cycles needed to reach 

the top of the linear range of amplification are about 27–28 cycles for 
nuclear DNA amplicons and about 17–19 cycles for mtDNA amplicons. 
Barcoding PCR2 reactions (25 μl) were performed with 1 μl of unpuri-
fied PCR1 product and amplified with Q5 Hot Start MasterMix (NEB) 
using the following protocol: 98 °C for 2 min, then 9 cycles of (98 °C for  
10 s, 61 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 30 s), followed by a final 72 °C extension 
for 2 min. PCR products were evaluated analytically by electrophore-
sis in a 1.5% agarose gel. After PCR2, up to 300 samples with different 
barcode combinations were combined and purified by gel extraction 
using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen). DNA concentration 
was quantified using the Qubit ssDNA HS Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher 
Scientific) to make up a 4 nM library. The library concentration was 
further verified by qPCR (KAPA Library Quantification Kit-Illumina, 
Kapa Biosystems) and sequenced using an Illumina MiSeq with 210- to 
300-bp single-end reads.

Analysis of high-throughput sequencing data for DNA 
sequencing and targeted amplicon sequencing
Sequencing reads were demultiplexed using MiSeq Reporter (Illumina). 
Batch analysis with CRISPResso253 was used for targeted amplicon and 
DNA sequencing analysis. A 10-bp window was used to quantify indels 
centred around the middle of the dsDNA spacing. To set the cleavage 
offset, a hypothetical 15-or 16-bp spacing region has a cleavage offset 
of −8. Otherwise, the default parameters were used for analysis. The 
output file “Reference.NUCLEOTIDE_PERCENTAGE_SUMMARY.txt” was 
imported into Microsoft Excel for quantification of editing frequen-
cies. Reads containing indels within the 10-bp window are excluded for 
calculation of editing frequencies. The output file “CRISPRessoBatch_
quantification_of_editing_frequency.txt” was imported into Microsoft 
Excel for quantification of indel frequencies. Indel frequencies were 
computed by dividing the sum of insertions and deletions over the 
total number of aligned reads.

Determination of relative total mitochondrial DNA levels by 
quantitative PCR
Quantitative PCR (qPCR) reactions were performed on a Bio-Rad 
CFX96/C1000 qPCR machine performed using SYBR green (Lonza). 
For Extended Data Fig. 6i, 5 ng of purified DNA was used as template 
input in a 25-μl reaction volume. For Extended Data Fig. 8a, 8 ng of 
purified DNA was used as template input in a 25-μl reaction volume. 
For all reactions, the protocol used was an initial heating step of 
2 min at 98 °C followed by 40 cycles of amplification (10 s at 98 °C, 
20 s at 62 °C, 15 s at 72 °C). Single threshold values (∆C) were deter-
mined by manufacturer’s software. For Extended Data Fig. 6i, the 
level of mtDNA was determined by the calculating the ratio of total 
mtDNA to genomic DNA (β-actin) (Ratio = EmtDNA
Eβ-actin ∆C(DdCBE – dead DdCBE), where E is the efficiency of the qPCR reaction; 
END6 = 0.858, END5 = 0.844, EATP8 = 0.995, Eβ-actin = 1.05). For the assessment 
of mtDNA level in Extended Data Fig. 8a, 8 ng of isolated DNA was used 
in qPCR reaction performed with the use of iQ SYBR Green Supermix 
(Bio-Rad). Relative abundance of the amplified ND1 gene fragment  
was normalized to the amplified B2M gene fragment. See Supplemen-
tary Table 13 for list of primers used. NC_012920 was used as the ref-
erence for mtDNA; NG_003019 was used as the reference for human 
ACTBP2.

RNA isolation and RT-qPCR
Total RNA was extracted from cells with the use of RNeasy Mini Kit 
(Qiagen) and digested with DNase I (Qiagen). Isolated RNA (500 ng) was 
used for reverse transcription performed with the use of SuperScript 
III First-Strand Synthesis SuperMix for qRT–PCR (Thermo Fisher). The 
obtained cDNA was used for qPCR. Analysis of mitochondrial gene 
expression was performed with the use of iQ SYBR Green Supermix 
(BioRad) using primers listed in Supplementary Table 13. Data was 
normalized to B2M abundance.

Oxygen consumption analysis by Seahorse XF analyser
Seahorse plate was coated with 0.01% (w/v) poly-l-lysine (Sigma). Cells 
(1.6 × 104) were seeded on the coated Seahorse plate 16 h before the anal-
ysis in the Seahorse XFe96 Analyzer (Agilent). Analysis was performed 
in the Seahorse XF DMEM Medium pH 7.4 (Agilent) supplemented with 
10 mM glucose (Agilent), 2 mM l-glutamine (Gibco) and 1 mM sodium 
pyruvate (Gibco). Mito stress protocol was applied with the use of  
1.5 mM oligomycin, 1 mM FCCP and 1 mM piericidin + 1 mM antimycin.

Complex I and IV activity assay
Complex I activity assay was performed with the use of colorimetric 
Complex I Enzyme Activity Microplate Assay Kit (Abcam) according to 
the manufacturer’s protocol. Complex IV activity assay was performed 
with the use of colorimetric Complex IV Human Enzyme Activity Micro-
plate Assay Kit (Abcam) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. In 
brief, cells were collected and washed twice with PBS (Gibco) followed 
by protein extraction and incubation of clarified cell lysates at concen-
tration of 0.25 mg ml−1 on the microplates for 3 h at room temperature. 
Complex I activity was determined by measurement of absorbance at 
OD = 450 nm, which is increased by reduction of a dye simultaneous 
to NADH to NAD+ oxidation. Complex IV activity was determined by 
measurement of absorbance at OD = 550 nm, which decreases follow-
ing oxidation of reduced cytochrome c.

Long-range PCR to detect mtDNA deletions
Long-range PCR was performed on purified genomic DNA as previously 
with listed primers (Supplementary Table 13) to capture the whole 
mtDNA genome as two overlapping fragment of around 8 kb each. In 
brief, around 50–200 ng of purified DNA was used as input for amplifi-
cation by PRIMESTAR GXL DNA polymerase (Takara). For all reactions, 
the protocol used was an initial heating step of 1 min at 94 °C followed 
by 30 cycles of amplification (30 s at 98 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, 9 min at 72 °C). 
Unpurified PCR products were run on 0.8% agarose gel and stained 
with ethidium bromide.

Immunocytochemical studies of DdCBE localization
HeLa cells were transfected with a total of 1 ug of plasmid DNA (500 ng 
for each monomer) to express left (HA-tagged) or right (Flag-tagged) 
monomers of each DdCBE using Lipofectamine 3000 (Thermo Fisher) 
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. After 24 h incubation, cells 
were labelled with MitoTracker Deep Red (Thermo Fisher) at a final 
concentration of 100 nM for 30 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator. Cells 
were then seeded on an 8-well chamber glass slide (Ibidi) and fixed in 
4% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 15 min at room temperature. Next, cells 
were washed twice with PBS and permeabilized in PBS containing 0.1% 
saponin and 1% BSA for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were then 
immunostained with anti-HA (Biolegend) or anti-Flag (Sigma Aldrich), 
followed by Alexa-Fluor conjugated anti-mouse (HA tag) or anti-rabbit 
(Flag tag) secondary antibodies (Thermo Fisher). Images were taken 
using a 60× objective with the high-resolution widefield Nikon system. 
Acquired images were processed in Fiji48.

Bulk ATAC–seq for whole mitochondrial genome sequencing
Assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing (ATAC–
seq) was performed as previously described54. In brief, 5,000–10,000 
cells were trypsinzed, washed with cold 1X PBS, pelleted by centrifuga-
tion (500g at 4 °C for 5 min) and lysed in 50 μl of cold and freshly pre-
pared lysis buffer (0.1% Igepal CA-360 (v/v %), 10 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM 
NaCl and 3 mM MgCl2 in nuclease-free water). Lysates were incubated 
on ice for 3 min, pelleted at 500g for 10 min at 4 °C and tagmented with 
2.5 μl of Tn5 transposase (Illumina, 15027865) in a total volume of 10 μl 
containing 1x TD buffer (Illumina, 15027866),0.1% NP-40 (Sigma) and 
0.3x PBS. Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min on a thermomixer 
at 300 rpm. DNA was purified using the MinElute PCR Kit (Qiagen) 

and eluted in 10 μl elution buffer. All 10 μl of the eluate was amplified 
using indexed primers (1.25 μM each) listed in Supplementary Table 13 
and NEBNext High-Fidelity 2X PCR Master Mix (NEB) in a total volume 
of 50 μl using the following protocol: 72 °C for 5 min, 98 °C for 30 s, 
then 5 cycles of (98 °C for 10 s, 63 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 60 s), fol-
lowed by a final 72 °C extension for 1 min. After the initial 5 cycles of 
pre-amplification, 5 μl of partially amplified library was used as input 
DNA in a total volume of 15 μl for quantitative PCR using SYBR Green 
(0.5x, Lonza) to determine the number of additional cycles needed to 
reach 1/3 of the maximum fluorescence intensity. Typically, 3–8 cycles 
were conducted on the remaining 45 μl of partially amplified library. 
The final library was purified using a MinElute PCR kit (Qiagen) and 
quantified using a Qubit dsDNA HS Assay kit (Invitrogen) and a High 
Sensitivity DNA chip run on a Bioanalyzer 2100 system (Agilent). All 
libraries were sequenced using Nextseq High Output Cartridge kits on 
an Illumina Nextseq 500 sequencer. Libraries were sequenced using 
paired-end 2×75 cycles and demultiplexed using the bcl2fastq program.

Targeted amplicon sequencing for nuclear DNA off-target 
analyses
Genomic DNA was isolated and purified as described in the section 
“Genomic DNA isolation from mammalian cell culture”. The on-target 
mtDNA binding sites for ND6-, ND5.1- and ND4-DdCBE were aligned to 
the NCBI reference sequence for human chromosome 5 (NC_000005.10) 
to identify MTND6P4, MTND5P11 and MTND4P12. These pseudogenes 
are regions in the nuclear DNA that contain the greatest homology to 
their respective DdCBE binding sites in mtDNA. Samples were pre-
pared for high-throughput sequencing as described in the section 
“High-throughput DNA sequencing of genomic DNA samples”. The 
following primers were used for appending sequencing adapters to 
MTND6P4: MTND6P4 forward: ACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCC 
GATCTNNNNGTTGTAGCCCGTGCAAGAATAATG; MTND6P4 reverse: 
TGGAGTTCAGACGTGTGCTCTTCCGATCTTAACACTAATCCTACTTCC 
ATC. For MTND5P11 and MTND4P12, a 5 kb region was amplified with 
primer set 1 (Forward 1 and Forward 2) to ensure selective ampli-
fication of nuclear DNA rather than mtDNA. The 5-kb fragment was 
purified using MinElute PCR Kit (Qiagen) and used as the DNA input 
for subsequent amplification steps using the indicated sequencing 
adaptor primers: Forward 1: CTAATTCTCTTTGAGGAGCATGGTTAG; 
Forward 2: TATCACTTCCAGCCACCTATTTCC; MTND5P11 forward: 
ACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCTNNNNGGAAGCGAGG

Genome sequencing and SNP identification in mitochondria
SNP identification in mitochondria was performed similarly to in bac-
teria, with the following modifications. Genome mapping was per-
formed with BWA (v.0.7.17) using NC_012920 genome as a reference. 
Duplicates were marked using Picard tools (v.2.20.7). Pileup data from 
alignments were generated with SAMtools (v.1.9) and variant calling 
was performed with VarScan2 (v.2.4.3). Variants that were present at a 
frequency greater than 0.1% and a P value less than 0.05 (Fisher’s exact 
test) were called as high-confidence SNPs independently in each bio-
logical replicate. Only reads with a Phred quality score (Q) of greater 
than 30 at a given position were taken into account when calling SNPs 
at that particular position.

Calculation of average off-target C•G-to-T•A editing frequency
To calculate the mitochondrial genome-wide average off-target edit-
ing frequency for each DdCBE in Fig. 5b, we used REDItools (v.1.2.1)55. 
All nucleobases except cytosines and guanines were removed and the 
number of reads covering each C•G base pair with a Phred quality score 

greater than 30 (Q > 30) was calculated. The on-target C•G base pairs 
(depending on the DdCBE used in each treatment) were excluded in 
order to consider only off-target effects. C•G-to-T•A SNVs present at 
high frequencies (greater than 50%) in both treated and untreated 
samples (that therefore did not arise from DdCBE treatment) were also 
excluded. The average off-target editing frequency was then calculated 
independently for each biological replicate of each treatment condition 
as: (number of reads in which a given C•G base pair was called as a T•A 
base pair, summed over all non-target C•G base pairs)/(total number 
of reads that covered all non-target C•G base pair). Sequence logos 
in Fig. 5c, depicting the local sequence context of all off-target SNVs, 
were generated as described previously56. For Supplementary Tables 8 
and 9, the average frequency of each SNV was calculated by taking the 
average of three frequencies from the biological triplicates.

Effect prediction of the C•G-to-T•A off-target SNVs identified by 
ATAC–seq
SIFT57 (https://sift.bii.a-star.edu.sg /) was used to predict the out-
come of nonsynonymous mutations on protein function. High- and 
low-confidence calls were made using standard SIFT parameters with 
GRCh37.74 database as the reference genome.

Statistics

For all statistical analyses, confirm that the following items are present in the figure legend, table legend, main text, or Methods section.

n/a Confirmed

The exact sample size (n) for each experimental group/condition, given as a discrete number and unit of measurement

A statement on whether measurements were taken from distinct samples or whether the same sample was measured repeatedly
The statistical test(s) used AND whether they are one- or two-sided 

Only common tests should be described solely by name; describe more complex techniques in the Methods section.

A description of all covariates tested

A description of any assumptions or corrections, such as tests of normality and adjustment for multiple comparisons

A full description of the statistical parameters including central tendency (e.g. means) or other basic estimates (e.g. regression coefficient) 
AND variation (e.g. standard deviation) or associated estimates of uncertainty (e.g. confidence intervals)

For null hypothesis testing, the test statistic (e.g. F, t, r) with confidence intervals, effect sizes, degrees of freedom and P value noted 

Give P values as exact values whenever suitable.

For Bayesian analysis, information on the choice of priors and Markov chain Monte Carlo settings

For hierarchical and complex designs, identification of the appropriate level for tests and full reporting of outcomes

Estimates of effect sizes (e.g. Cohen's d, Pearson's r), indicating how they were calculated

Our web collection on statistics for biologists contains articles on many of the points above.

Policy information about availability of computer code
Data collection

High-throughput sequencing data was collected on Illumina Miseq and Nextseq instruments. 

Data analysis

High-throughput sequencing data was analyzed using CRISPResso2 Sequencing reads were demultiplexed using the MiSeq Reporter 
(Illumina) and fastq files were analyzed using Crispresso2. Prism 8 (GraphPad) was used to generate dot plots and bar plots of these data.  
For mitochondrial genome analysis, Genome mapping was performed with BWA (v0.7.17) using NC_012920 genome as a reference. 
Duplicates were marked using Picard tools (v2.20.7). Pileup data from alignments were generated with SAMtools (v1.9) and variant 
calling was performed with VarScan2 (v2.4.3). Variants that were present at a frequency greater than 0.1% and a p-value less than 0.05 
(Fisher’s Exact Test) were called as high-confidence SNPs independently in each biological replicate. Only reads with Q > 30 at a given 
position were taken into account when calling SNPs at that particular position. Further details and references and provided in the 
Methods. For the generation of sequence logos, flanking sequences were aligned, fixing the mutant cytosine in each case at position 21, 
and the resulting alignment was used to produce a sequence logo using WebLogo 3.6.0. Further details and references are provided in 
the Methods.

For manuscripts utilizing custom algorithms or software that are central to the research but not yet described in published literature, software must be made available to editors/reviewers. 
We strongly encourage code deposition in a community repository (e.g. GitHub). See the Nature Research guidelines for submitting code & software for further information.

Bacterial toxins represent a vast reservoir of biochemical diversity that can be 
repurposed for biomedical applications. Such proteins include a group of predicted 
interbacterial toxins of the deaminase superfamily, members of which have found 
application in gene-editing techniques1,2. Because previously described cytidine 
deaminases operate on single-stranded nucleic acids3, their use in base editing 
requires the unwinding of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA)—for example by a CRISPR–
Cas9 system. Base editing within mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), however, has thus far 
been hindered by challenges associated with the delivery of guide RNA into the 
mitochondria4. As a consequence, manipulation of mtDNA to date has been limited to 
the targeted destruction of the mitochondrial genome by designer nucleases9,10.Here 
we describe an interbacterial toxin, which we name DddA, that catalyses the 
deamination of cytidines within dsDNA. We engineered split-DddA halves that are 
non-toxic and inactive until brought together on target DNA by adjacently bound 
programmable DNA-binding proteins. Fusions of the split-DddA halves, transcription 
activator-like effector array proteins, and a uracil glycosylase inhibitor resulted in 
RNA-free DddA-derived cytosine base editors (DdCBEs) that catalyse C•G-to-T•A 
conversions in human mtDNA with high target specificity and product purity. We used 
DdCBEs to model a disease-associated mtDNA mutation in human cells, resulting in 
changes in respiration rates and oxidative phosphorylation. CRISPR-free DdCBEs 
enable the precise manipulation of mtDNA, rather than the elimination of mtDNA 
copies that results from its cleavage by targeted nucleases, with broad implications 
for the study and potential treatment of mitochondrial disorders.

Inherited or acquired mutations in mtDNA are associated with a range 
of human diseases5,6. Tools for introducing specific modifications into 
mtDNA are urgently needed both to model and to potentially treat 
these diseases. The development of such tools, however, has been 
hindered by the challenge of transporting RNAs into mitochondria, 
including guide RNAs that are required to program CRISPR-associated 
proteins4.
Each mammalian cell contains many copies of a circular mtDNA that 
can exist in a heteroplasmic mixture of wild-type and mutant alleles7. 
Current approaches to manipulate mtDNA rely on RNA-free program-
mable nucleases, such as transcription activator-like effector nucleases 
(TALENs)8,9 and zinc finger nucleases10, fused to mitochondrial target-
ing signal (MTS) sequences to induce double-strand breaks in mtDNA. 
Linearized mtDNA is rapidly degraded11,12, resulting in heteroplasmic 
shifts to favour uncut mtDNA genomes. As a candidate therapeutic 
or disease-modelling tool, this approach cannot introduce specific 

nucleotide changes in mtDNA, and cannot be applied to homoplasmic 
mtDNA mutations because destroying all mtDNA copies is presumed 
to be harmful7,11.
An alternative to the targeted destruction of mtDNA through 
double-strand breaks is precision genome editing, a capability that—
to the best of our knowledge—has not been previously reported for 
mtDNA. The ability to precisely install or correct pathogenic mutations 
could accelerate the modelling of diseases caused by mtDNA mutations, 
facilitate preclinical drug candidate testing, and potentially enable 
therapeutic approaches that directly correct pathogenic mtDNA muta-
tions. Although cytidine and adenosine deaminases are important for 
precision genome editing by enabling base editing in the nucleus1,2,13,14, 
their biochemical and functional diversity remain largely unexplored. 
Bacterial genomes contain various uncharacterized deaminases15, rais-
ing the possibility that some may possess unique activities that enable 
new genome-editing capabilities.

An interbacterial deaminase-like toxin

Some predicted bacterial deaminases contain sequences that suggest 
them to be substrates for intercellular protein delivery systems, such as 
the type VI secretion system (T6SS)15. This system mediates antagonism 
between Gram-negative bacteria by transferring antibacterial toxins 
into contacting cells16,17. Given their sequence divergence from char-
acterized deaminases, we sought to define the biochemical activity of 
T6SS-associated deaminases. We focused on a predicted deaminase 
belonging to the SCP1.201-like family15, henceforth referred to as DddA, 
encoded by Burkholderia cenocepacia (Fig. 1a). A B. cenocepacia strain 
lacking dddA and the downstream predicted immunity gene (dddIA) 
exhibited a marked growth defect when co-cultivated with the wild-type 
strain (Fig. 1b, Extended Data Fig. 1a, b). This defect was not observed 
in co-culture with a strain that lacked the activity of a T6SS (∆icmF1) or 
with a strain that expressed DddA containing an amino acid substitution 
of a predicted catalytic residue (dddAE1347A) . These data establish DddA 
as an antibacterial toxin that is delivered by the T6SS.
Members of the deaminase superfamily are known to catalyse the 
deamination of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), RNA, free nucleosides, 
nucleotides, nucleobases and other nucleotide derivatives15. To define the 
substrate of DddA, which belongs to a clade of predicted deaminases that 
lack a characterized member15, we first determined whether deaminases 
that represent the substrate range of the superfamily are toxic if expressed 
in bacteria. The growth of Escherichia coli was unaffected by the production 
of deaminases that act on ssDNA, tRNA or free cytidine (Fig. 1c, Extended 
Data Fig. 1c). By contrast, DddA markedly reduced the viability of E. coli 
(Fig. 1c). We identified amino acids 1264–1427 of DddA as the domain that 
confers toxicity, referred to henceforth as DddAtox (see Methods for details 
of the identification of the toxin domain). These findings suggested that 
DddA may act on a previously undescribed deaminase substrate.

DddA is a double-stranded DNA deaminase

To further clarify the substrate and mechanism of DddAtox, we deter-
mined a co-crystal structure of DddAtox bound to the immunity protein 
DddIA at 2.5 Å resolution (Supplementary Table 1). DddAtox adopts a 
typical deaminase fold consisting of a five-stranded β-sheet with but-
tressing helices that contribute catalytic residues (Fig. 1d). DddIA con-
tains a central β-sheet that occludes the active site of DddAtox (Fig. 1d). 
Structure-based homology searches revealed APOBEC enzymes as the 
closest structural relatives of DddAtox, with divergence at the C-terminal 
β-strands; these strands are antiparallel with an extended intervening 
loop in DddAtox, whereas they are parallel with an intervening α-helix 
in APOBEC enzymes (Fig. 1d, e).
So far, all reported DNA cytidine deaminases operate predominantly on 
ssDNA, often with a preference for the base immediately 5′ of the substrate 
C3. We measured the in vitro activity of DddAtox on a ssDNA substrate con-
taining cytosine in all four possible 5′-NC contexts. Whereas the activity of 
APOBEC3A was readily detected, DddAtox did not catalyse uracil formation 
within ssDNA sequences (Fig. 1f ). As a control, we included a related dsDNA 
substrate. Consistent with previous studies18, APOBEC3A did not display 
measurable activity against dsDNA. Unexpectedly, however, DddAtox 
efficiently converted cytosine to uracil within dsDNA (Fig. 1g, Extended 
Data Fig. 1d). The catalytically inactive enzyme, DddAtox(E1347A), showed 
no uracil formation, indicating that deamination was dependent on the 
activity of DddAtox. We did not detect deamination of single-stranded or 
double-stranded RNA substrates by DddAtox (Extended Data Fig. 1e, f ). 
These results collectively establish DddAtox as a cytidine deaminase that 
operates preferentially on dsDNA; the enzyme was therefore named 
‘double-stranded DNA deaminase toxin A’, or DddA.
If DddAtox converts cytosine to uracil specifically within dsDNA, the 
enzyme should be mutagenic in a manner that is dependent on uracil

DNA glycosylase (UDG), which initiates base excision repair through 
uracil removal19. Indeed, expression of sub-lethal levels of DddAtox in  
E. coli substantially increased the mutation frequency, and these 
mutagenic effects of DddAtox were enhanced more than 100-fold in an  
E. coli strain lacking UDG (Fig. 1h). We next used the high mutation rate 
caused by sub-lethal DddAtox levels to profile the sequence context 
preference of the enzyme. We performed whole-genome sequencing 
on five E. coli lineages that experienced serial DddAtox exposure and 
clonal bottlenecking, and five control strains that underwent a simi-
lar regimen in the presence of DddAtox(E1347A). Consistent with our 
mutation-frequency measurements, we observed approximately 50-fold 
more total single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in strains exposed 
to active DddAtox (997) than in strains producing the inactive enzyme 
(17), and more than 99% of the DddAtox-dependent SNPs were C•G-to-T•A 
transitions (Extended Data Fig. 2a–c). The alignment of sequences flank-
ing the converted cytosine within these C•G-to-T•A mutations revealed 
a strong preference for 5′-TC contexts (Fig. 1i), matching the sequence 
preference of the enzyme in vitro (Extended Data Fig. 2d). Together, these 
findings reveal that DddAtox deaminates dsDNA substrates in vitro and 
in bacterial cells with a preference for 5′-TC contexts.

Splitting DddAtox into non-toxic halves

Current base editors deaminate nucleotides in ssDNA loops created by 
RNA-guided CRISPR proteins1,13,14. The ability of DddAtox to deaminate 
cytidines in dsDNA raises the possibility of using RNA-free program-
mable dsDNA-binding proteins, such as zinc-finger arrays20 or TALE 
repeat arrays21, to direct DddAtox to mtDNA targets without requiring 
CRISPR or guide RNAs.
As expected (Fig. 1b, c), the expression of intact DddAtox fused to 
programmable DNA-binding proteins was toxic to human HEK293T 

cells (Supplementary Discussion). To avoid this toxicity, we proposed 
splitting the protein into two inactive halves, one containing the N ter-
minus of DddAtox (DddAtox-N) and the other containing the C terminus 
(DddAtox-C). These halves would reconstitute deamination activity only 
when assembled adjacently on target DNA, analogous to the assembly 
of FokI monomers to reconstitute dsDNA nuclease activity in zinc finger 
nucleases20 and TALENs21.
On the basis of the DddAtox–DddIA co-crystal structure, we split DddAtox 
into DddAtox-N and DddAtox-C halves at seven sites within loops (Fig. 2a), 
naming each split to reflect the last residue of DddAtox-N. Screening of 
split sites was performed with CRISPR–Cas9 proteins to facilitate testing 
of split DddAtox variants directed to target DNA half-sites with different 
spacing region lengths22 (Supplementary Table 2). Each DddAtox half was 
fused to the N terminus of dSpCas923 or an orthogonal Staphylococcus 
aureus Cas9 variant (SaKKH-Cas9)24. Each split was assayed in its two 
possible fusion orientations: SaKKH-Cas9 fused either to DddAtox-N 
(‘aureus-N’) or to DddAtox-C (‘aureus-C’) (Fig. 2b, c). The top DNA strand 
of test sites contained more TC motifs than the bottom strand and was 
therefore more likely to be edited by DddAtox (Extended Data Fig. 3). To 
enhance edits at target sites, we used SaKKH-Cas9(D10A) nickase25to 
nick the bottom strand, in order to promote its resynthesis using the 
edited top DNA strand as a template13,14,26,27.
Among active split-DddAtox–Cas9 fusions, we observed C•G-to-T•A 
conversions in the spacing region between the two protospacers 
(Fig. 2d, Extended Data Fig. 3). All editing efficiencies in this study 
report the fraction of sequenced alleles with the desired C•G-to-T•A 
edit among all treated cells with no enrichment. Notably, we observed 
no on-target editing in the absence of guide RNAs or when only one 
DddAtox–Cas9 half and its guide RNA were present (Supplementary 
Table 3), indicating that editing is strictly dependent on the reassembly 
of both DddAtox halves at the Cas9-specified target site.

Among the seven splits tested, splits at G1333 and G1397 yielded 
the highest editing efficiencies of 22%–48% at the most highly edited 
position within the target spacing region (Extended Data Fig. 3b, g, h, 
Supplementary Discussion). For a given fusion orientation, the editing 
efficiencies of target bases were dependent on their positions within 
the spacing region; for example, G1397 aureus-C yielded 20%–22% edit-
ing at a target TC14 (the 14th nucleotide of the spacing region between 
the two target protospacers) within 17- and 23-bp spacing regions, and 
41% within a 44-bp spacing region (Fig. 2d). These results collectively 
suggest that splitting DddAtox at G1333 and G1397 produces halves 
that reconstitute at a target site to mediate C•G-to-T•A conversion 
in human cells. Spacing region length, target cytosine position and 
split orientation are all determinants of the base-editing efficiency 
of split-DddAtox.

Nuclear base editing by TALE–DddAtox

Because DddAtox split at G1333 or G1397 can deaminate target TCs within 
a modest spacing region (Supplementary Discussion), we speculated 
that fusing split DddAtox halves to TALE array proteins that bind neigh-
bouring DNA sites might result in CRISPR-free, RNA-free base editing 
in human cells.

We fused DddAtox halves split at G1333 to TALE array proteins con-
taining a bipartite nuclear localization signal (bpNLS) to bind nuclear 
DNA sequences flanking an 18-bp spacing region within CCR5 in U2OS 
cells (Extended Data Fig. 4a). Compared with simple fusions that do not 
contain a uracil glycosylase inhibitor (UGI), appending two copies of 
UGI (2×-UGI)14,28 to the N terminus increased the editing efficiency at C9 
by approximately 8-fold (to 22%–27%) and reduced indels to less than 
2.3 ± 0.31% (mean ± s.d.). Fusing 2×-UGI to the C terminus through a 2- or 
a 16-amino-acid linker resulted in lower editing efficiencies of 12 ± 3.5% or 
3.3 ± 1.3%, respectively (Extended Data Fig. 4a). These results collectively 
demonstrate that split DddAtox can be fused to TALE arrays to mediate 
C•G-to-T•A conversions in human nuclear DNA, and that fusing UGI to these 
proteins enhances editing efficiencies and reduces indel byproducts14,28.

Mitochondrial base editing by TALE–DddAtox

To apply TALE–split DddAtox fusions for mitochondrial base editing, 
we fused split DddAtox halves to MTS-linked TALE proteins that target 
MT-ND69, a mitochondrial gene that encodes the NADH dehydroge-
nase 6 subunit of complex I (Supplementary Table 4). Among fusions 
that did not contain UGI, we observed the highest level of mtDNA 
target editing (4.9 ± 0.17%) for the architecture that comprised the

C-terminal half of DddAtox split at G1397 and bound to the right TALE 
assembled with the N-terminal half of DddAtox split at G1397 and 
bound to the left TALE (Right–G1397-C + Left–G1397-N; Extended Data  
Fig. 5a, b).
In contrast to nuclear-localized TALE–DddAtox, fusing one or two 
UGI proteins to the N terminus of each mitoTALE–DddAtox half did not 
enhance C•G-to-T•A conversion. Appending one UGI to the C terminus, 
however, increased editing levels by three- to tenfold compared with con-
structs that lacked UGI (up to 16%–27% for C6, C7 and C13 in TC contexts). 
Adding a second copy of UGI to the C terminus did not further increase 
mtDNA editing efficiencies (Fig. 3a). UGI probably inhibits mitochon-
drial UNG1 to enhance editing efficiencies by impeding uracil excision29. 
Removing the MTS sequences or replacing them with a bpNLS was found 
to abrogate editing, demonstrating that MT-ND6 editing is dependent on 
the mitochondrial localization of the mitoTALE–DddAtox fusions (Fig. 3a).
Fluorescence microscopy images revealed that, whereas MTS–
mitoTALE–split-DddAtox–UGI fusions localized to the mitochondria 
in HeLa cells, MTS–UGI–mitoTALE–split-DddAtox fusions remained 
diffused throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 3b). These findings explain 
the observed dependence of editing efficiency on the position of 
UGI fusion and suggest that proximity between the MTS and an 
N-terminal UGI may impede mitochondrial import of the fusion  
protein.
These results collectively suggested the following optimized mito-
TALE–split-DddAtox architecture (in N- to C-terminus order): an MTS, a 

TALE array, a two-amino-acid linker, a DddAtox half from the G1333 or G1397 
split, and one UGI protein (Fig. 3c). This architecture, hereafter referred 
to as DddA-derived cytosine base editor (DdCBE), represents—to our 
knowledge—the first agent that is capable of performing precise genome 
editing in mtDNA. The application of DdCBE contrasts with previously 
reported uses of nucleases to make double-strand breaks in mtDNA, which 
result in the loss of targeted mtDNA copies and in heteroplasmic shifts8–10.
Given that DddAtox can edit cytosines on either DNA strand, inter-
mediates that contain uracils on opposing DNA strands could produce 
double-strand breaks during DNA repair, causing unwanted indels. 
Although the standard cytosine base editor BE4max30—when targeted 
to EMX1 in the nucleus—resulted in 1.8 ± 0.67% indels in HEK293T cells, 
indels were not detected (less than 0.1%) at MT-ND6 despite DdCBE edit-
ing both mtDNA strands (Fig. 3c, Extended Data Fig. 4b, c). Indeed, we 
observed very high product purities (at least 99.5%) for DdCBE-mediated 
mtDNA base editing of MT-ND6 in HEK293T cells and in U2OS cells—
exceeding the product purities resulting from the editing of CCR5 by 
nuclear-targeted BE4max (96 ± 0.78%) and by nuclear-targeted DdCBE 
(95 ± 0.52%) (Fig. 3d, Extended Data Fig. 4d). These results suggest that 
the DNA repair processes that lead to indels and other byproducts in 
nuclear DNA19 are inefficient in mitochondria (Supplementary Discus-
sion; see Fig. 3e for MT-ND6 allele frequencies in HEK293T cells after 
treatment with MT-ND6-DdCBE, denoted as ND6-DdCBE). Instead, 
lesion-containing mtDNA is degraded rather than repaired11, resulting 
in the selective maintenance of cleanly edited mtDNA copies.

These findings establish a precision mtDNA editing platform, which 
uses a dsDNA-specific cytidine deaminase that is split to mitigate toxicity, 
programmable dsDNA-binding TALE arrays localized to the mitochon-
dria, and a UGI to achieve RNA-free base editing in the mitochondria.

Base editing of five mtDNA genes

To explore the generality of DdCBE for mtDNA editing, we engineered or 
adapted seven pairs of TALE arrays (Supplementary Table 4) to target five 
mitochondrial genes: MT-ND1, MT-ND2, MT-ND4, MT-ND5 and MT-ATP8.
Three to six days after treatment, mitochondrial base-editing effi-
ciencies of DdCBEs in HEK293T cells varied between 4.6% and 49% 
depending on the split type, split orientation and target cytosine posi-
tion within the spacing region. For DdCBEs using the G1333 split, the 
Right–G1333-C + Left–G1333-N orientation resulted in 2.1- to 15-fold 
higher editing efficiencies than the Right–G1333-N + Left–G1333-C 
orientation, regardless of the spacing length and positions of TC tar-
get bases (Fig. 4a–e, g). By contrast, the effect of split orientation on 
editing efficiencies was more site-dependent for G1397 (Fig. 4b, d–f ).
Collectively, optimized G1397-split DdCBEs mediated average 
base-editing efficiencies of 42% at each of four well-edited mtDNA sites 
(Fig. 4a–c, e) and average efficiencies of 9.0% at two modestly edited 
sites (Fig. 4d, f ), whereas the most efficient G1333-split DdCBEs yielded 
43% average conversion at three sites (Fig. 4a–c) and 7.4% average effi-
ciencies at three other sites (Fig. 4d, e, g). We did not detect indels or 
base editing outside the spacing region (Supplementary Tables 5, 6).
Within 14–18-bp spacing regions, G1397-split DdCBE preferen-
tially edited TCs that were positioned approximately 4–7 nucleotides 
upstream of the 3′ end of the spacing region in either mtDNA strand. By

contrast, G1333-split DdCBE preferentially edited TCs that were posi-
tioned approximately 4–10 nucleotides from the 5′ end of the spacing 
region in either mtDNA strand (Fig. 4h). These results indicate that each 
split edits TCs with a preference for specific windows in the spacing 
region. For a given target sequence, we recommend testing G1397 and 
G1333 splits in both orientations, using spacing lengths and TALE-binding 
sites guided by the above principles (Supplementary Discussion).
We confirmed the durability of mtDNA edits in HEK293T cells over 18 
days (Extended Data Fig. 6a–d, Supplementary Discussion). In addition, 
mtDNA editing did not reduce cell viability, produced no large mtDNA 
deletions, and did not perturb mtDNA copy numbers (Extended Data 
Fig. 6g–i, Supplementary Discussion). We observed a substantial reduc-
tion in editing when mtDNA replication was blocked by induced expres-
sion of a dominant negative mitochondrial polymerase gamma mutant31 
(Extended Data Fig. 7). We speculate that during mtDNA replication, repli-
cative polymerases incorporate A opposite U to resolve the U•G intermedi-
ate into a T•A base pair. DdCBE-mediated mtDNA editing in non-dividing 
cells should be feasible because mtDNA replication proceeds even in 
post-mitotic cells32. Indeed, untransformed primary human fibroblasts 
also supported efficient mtDNA base editing (typically 30%–40%) (Fig. 4i) 
despite dividing much less frequently than HEK293T cells, indicating that 
the use of DdCBE is not limited to immortalized cell lines.
Given that mutations in mtDNA genes that encode complex I subunits 
are thought to be pathogenic in rare tumours of the thyroid and kidney6,33, 
we investigated the consequences of editing MT-ND4 in cells containing 
the m.11922G>A mutation (for the characterization of other edited sites, 
see Extended Data Fig. 8c–f and Supplementary Discussion). Compared 
with control cells treated with catalytically inactive DdCBE, cells treated 
with ND4-DdCBE had lower rates of oxidative phosphorylation (Fig. 4j) 
and decreased basal and uncoupled respiration rates (Fig. 4k)—consistent 
with the disruption of complex I. Mitochondrial DNA homeostasis and 
associated transcripts were unchanged (Extended Data Fig. 8a, b). Also 
consistent with a specific defect in complex I, the enzymatic activity and 
assembly of complex I—but not of complex IV—were markedly reduced 
in these cells (Fig. 4l, m). These results establish that precise DdCBE 
editing can be applied to study mitochondrial phenotypes arising from 
disease-associated mtDNA mutations.

Off-target editing by DdCBEs

To profile the off-target activity of DdCBE in the human mitochondrial 
genome, we transfected HEK293T cells with plasmids that constitutively 
expressed optimized DdCBE or the corresponding dead-DdCBE con-
trol in order to distinguish DdCBE-induced single-nucleotide variants 
(SNVs) from background heteroplasmy. To test for possible editing 
arising as a result of the spontaneous assembly of split DddAtox in the 
absence of TALE-directed DNA binding, cells were also transfected with 
plasmids expressing MTS–G1397 split–UGI, with no TALE array (Fig. 5a).
The average frequencies of mitochondrial genome-wide off-target 
C•G-to-T•A editing by MTND5P2-DdCBE (denoted as ND5.2-DdCBE), 
ND4-DdCBE and ATP8-DdCBE (0.030%–0.034%) were similar to those 
of the untreated and dead-DdCBE controls (0.024%–0.030%), whereas 
MTND5P1-DdCBE (denoted as ND5.1-DdCBE) had a 1.6-fold higher aver-
age off-target editing frequency (0.049%) compared with the untreated 
control (Fig. 5b). We attribute the unusually high average off-target 
editing frequency by ND6-DdCBE (0.13%) to the permissive mutant 
N-terminal domain (NTD) of TALE (Fig. 3a), which may increase the 
non-specific binding of TALE arrays. Off-target mutations from the 
spontaneous reassembly of TALE-free split DddAtox were not detected 
at greater levels than in untreated cells (Fig. 5b). Notably, we did not 
observe significant off-target editing at nuclear pseudogenes, even 
though they differ by only 1–2 bp from the mtDNA on-target sites 
(Extended Data Fig. 9).
DdCBEs with standard NTDs generally exhibited 150- to 860-fold 
higher on-target editing relative to off-target editing, with no strong 

correlation between on-target editing efficiencies and off-target activ-
ity (Supplementary Table 8). Because all of these standard DdCBEs 
exhibit similar protein expression levels (Extended Data Fig. 6f ) and 
share wild-type NTDs and deaminase domains but have different TALE 
repeats, we conclude that TALE domains influence off-target activity. 
Moreover, TALE–split DddA fusions must be positioned in close prox-
imity for both on-target and off-target editing (Extended Data Fig. 10).
To further investigate the nature of off-target edits (see Extended 
Data Fig. 11 for predicted effect of off-target SNVs on protein function), 
we searched the 20-bp regions flanking each off-target SNV for any 
sequence homology to the on-target TALE-binding sites. Although we 
noted a strong 5′-TC-3′ preference for ND6-DdCBE and ND5.1-DdCBE 
off-target edits that matches the sequence preference for free DddAtox 
in E. coli (Fig. 1i, Supplementary Discussion), we did not observe any 
consensus off-target sequences that closely resemble on-target TALE 
binding sites (Fig. 5c). In addition, up to 20%–80% of SNVs identified 
for each DdCBE overlapped with those of other DdCBEs containing 
distinct TALE arrays programmed to bind different on-target sites 
(Supplementary Data 2, Supplementary Table 9). Collectively, these 
results suggest that off-target editing does not arise from editing at 
sequences similar to on-target sites. Instead, we speculate that DdCBE 
halves containing TALE arrays with greater non-specific DNA binding 
activity34 are more likely to bind proximally to transiently reassemble 
active DddAtox, which can then engage off-target mtDNA regions with 
no necessary homology to the on-target site.

Discussion

This study describes an interbacterial cytidine deaminase toxin specific for 
dsDNA, and its development into a CRISPR-free, RNA-free base editor that 
can install targeted mutations in the human mitochondrial genome with 
typical efficiencies ranging between 5% and 50%. The resulting DdCBEs 
enable programmable C•G-to-T•A conversions in mtDNA without requiring 
double-strand breaks, a capability that has the potential to model mito-
chondrial disease mutations, correct pathogenic variants (Supplementary 
Table 10) and expand our knowledge of mitochondrial biology.
Additional research will be needed to fully elucidate the principles 
that govern the efficiency and specificity of DdCBE. Developing in vitro 
and in vivo strategies to deliver DdCBEs will be essential for exploring 
their therapeutic potential in other cell types and in animal models 
of mitochondrial diseases. Exploring additional sources of natural 
diversity among bacterial DNA deaminases, or engineering DddA-
tox variants with altered sequence context and substrate preferences 
beyond 5′-TC-3′, would further expand the scope of mtDNA editing. 
Finally, although this study has focused on the use of DdCBE for mito-
chondrial base editing, some features of DdCBE (or zinc-finger array 
variants35)—such as its all-protein composition, its lack of requirement 
for a protospacer adjacent motif, and its independence from CRISPR 
components—may also offer advantages for base editing in cells and 
organelles beyond mitochondria.

Methods

No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. The 
experiments were not randomized and the investigators were not 
blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment.

Bacterial strains and culture conditions
Unless otherwise noted, all bacterial strains used in this study were 
grown in Lysogeny Broth (LB) at 37 °C or on LB medium solidified with 
agar (LBA, 1.5% w/v, except as noted). When required, media was sup-
plemented with the following: carbenicillin (150 μg ml−1) gentamycin (15 
μg ml−1), IPTG (80 μM, except as noted), rhamnose (0.05% w/v, except 
as noted), chloramphenicol (10 μg ml−1) or tetracycline (20 μg ml−1 for 
E. coli, 120 μg ml−1 for B. cenocepacia). E. coli strains DH5α, XK1502 and 
BL21 were used for plasmid maintenance, toxicity and mutagenesis 
assays, and protein expression, respectively. B. cenocepacia strains 
were derived from the cystic fibrosis clinical isolate H111. A detailed 
description of the bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study is 
provided in Supplementary Table 11.

Genetic techniques and plasmid construction for bacterial 
expression
All procedures for DNA manipulation and transformation were per-
formed with standard methods. Molecular biology reagents, Phusion 
high fidelity DNA polymerase, restriction enzymes, and Gibson Assem-
bly Reagent were obtained from New England Biolabs (NEB). GoTaq 
Green Master Mix was obtained from Promega. Primers and gBlocks 
used in this study were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies 
(IDT). A list of all primers used in bacterial studies is provided in Sup-
plementary Table 12.
Protein expression constructs were generated by Gibson assembly. 
The toxin domain of DddA was identified by remote homology with 
characterized deaminase domains identified through HMMER36. For 
functional protein expression assays of DddAtox, TadA and CDD, the 
relevant genes or gene fragments were amplified from B. cenocepacia 
(DddAtox) or E. coli genomic DNA and cloned into the vector pSCRhaB2. 
The gene encoding DddIA was amplified from B. cenocepacia and cloned 
into pPSV39, and the expression construct for DddAtox(E1347A) was 
generated by overlap extension PCR followed by Gibson assembly 
with pSCRhaB2. For the APOBEC3G expression construct, the gene 
sequence was codon optimized for expression in E. coli, generated by 
synthesis as a gBLOCK (IDT) and cloned into pSCRhaB2. For protein 
purification, genes encoding DddAtox and DddAI were amplified from 
B. cenocepacia and cloned into pETDuet.
In-frame gene deletions and nucleotide substitutions in B. ceno-
cepacia were performed by homologous recombination using the 
plasmid pDONRPEX18Tp-SceI-pheS, followed by counter-selection 
using the plasmid pDAI-SceI and plasmid curing using 0.1% (w/v) 
p-chlorophenylalanine, as described previously37. B. cenocepacia 
contains two complete T6SSs38 and both were inactivated (∆icmF1, 
I35_RS01770; ∆icmF2, I35_RS17395) and tested in this study. The 
∆icmF2 mutation did not influence DddA-dependent intercellular 
intoxication and is thus not included in Fig. 1b for the sake of brev-
ity. Gentamycin-resistant B. cenocepacia was generated by insertion 
of a resistance cassette at the Tn7 site attachment site as described 
previously39.

Plasmid construction for mammalian expression
PCR was performed using Phusion U Green Multiplex PCR Master Mix 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific), Phusion U Green Hot Start DNA Polymerase 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) or Q5 Hot Start High-Fidelity DNA Polymer-
ase (New England Biolabs). All plasmids were constructed using USER 
cloning (New England Biolabs). DddAtox and mitoTALE genes were syn-
thesized as gene blocks and codon optimized for human expression 
(Genscript). BE4max was obtained according to a previous report30. 

BE2max (rAPOBEC1–dSpCas9–UGI–UGI) was cloned from a BE4max 
plasmid. Compared with BE214, BE2max contains an extra UGI protein 
and uses codon optimization from BE4max. DddAtox–Cas9 fusions and 
DdCBE variants were cloned into pCMV (mammalian codon-optimized) 
backbones. sgRNA plasmids were constructed by blunt-end ligation of 
a linear polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product generated by encod-
ing the 20- to 23-nt variable protospacer sequence onto the 5′ end of an 
amplification primer and treating the resulting piece with KLD Enzyme 
Mix (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 
Mach1 chemically competent E. coli cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific) 
were used for plasmid construction. E. coli strain DH5α:dddI was used to 
construct intact DddAtox–Cas9 plasmids. Plasmids for mammalian trans-
fection were purified using ZymoPURE II Plasmid Midiprep Kits (Zymo 
Research), as previously described40. A list of all primers used in mam-
malian expression constructs is provided in Supplementary Table 13.

Bacterial competition experiments
Bacterial competition experiments were used to evaluate the fitness of 
B. cenocepacia strains in interbacterial interactions. Donor and recipi-
ent strains were grown overnight and mixed in a 10:1 (v/v) ratio for donor 
and recipient, respectively. Cell suspensions were then concentrated to 
a total optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 10, and 10 μl was spotted on a 
0.2 μm nitrocellulose membrane placed on LBA (3% w/v) and incubated 
for 6 h at 37 °C. After incubation, cells were scraped from the membrane 
surface and resuspended in 1 ml LB. The initial donor:recipient ratio 
and the post-incubation ratio were determined by plating on LB agar 
(LBA) to determine the total number of colony forming units (cfu) and 
on LBA with gentamycin to quantify cfu of the recipient strain.

Toxicity assays
To evaluate the toxicity of deaminases expressed heterologously, over-
night cultures of E. coli XK1502 containing the appropriate plasmids 
were diluted 1:1,000 into fresh medium and grown until they reached 
exponential phase (OD600 0.6), at which point deaminase expression 
was induced with rhamnose (0.2% w/v). Aliquots of cultures were then 
collected periodically until 480 min of growth and were diluted and 
plated onto LBA for c.f.u determination.

Crystallization and structure determination
Crystals of the selenomethionine derivative hexahistidine-tagged 
DddAtox (aa 1264–1427)·DddIA complex were obtained at 5–10 mg 
ml−1 in crystallization buffer (15 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1.0 mM 
tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP)), mixed 1:1 with crystallization 
solution containing 25% (w/v) PEG 3350, 0.1 M Bis-Tris:HCl pH 6.5,  
200 mM MgCl2. Rectangular crystals grew to 400 × 200 × 100 μm over  
5 days. Selenomethionine DddAtox·DddIA crystals displayed the 
symmetry of space group P21212 (a = 126.8 Å, b = 145.0 Å, c = 64.2 Å, 
α = β = γ = 90°), with four dimers in the asymmetric unit. Before data 
collection, crystals were cryoprotected in crystallization solution  
(15% glycerol, 25% PEG3350, 100 mM MgCl2, 100 mM NaCl, 7.5 mM Tris 
pH 7.5, 50 mM Bis-Tris pH 6.5, 0.5 mM TCEP).
Highly redundant anomalous (SAD) data were obtained at 0.9790 Å  
(peak) wavelength from a single selenomethionine crystal at 100 K 
temperature at the BL502 beamline (ALS, Lawrence Berkeley National 
Laboratory). Data were processed using HKL200041. Heavy-atom 
searching using phenix.autosol identified 18 possible sites, and refine-
ment yielded an estimated Bayes correlation coefficient of 55.9 to 2.5 Å 
resolution. After density modification, the estimated Bayes correlation 
coefficient increased to 61.2. Approximately 70% of the selenomethio-
nine model was constructed automatically, and the remaining portion 
was built manually. The current model (Supplementary Table 1) con-
tains four DddA·DddIA dimers.
Refinement was carried out against peak anomalous data with 
Bijvoet pairs kept separate using phenix.refine42 interspersed with 
manual model revisions using the program Coot43 and consisted of 

conjugate-gradient minimization and calculation of individual atomic 
displacement and translation/libration/screw parameters44. Residues 
that could not be identified in the electron density were: 1250–1289 and 
1423–1427 for DddA, and 71–73 for DddIA. Both models exhibit excel-
lent geometry, as determined by MolProbity45. Ramachandran analysis 
identified 99.1% favoured, 0.9% allowed and 0% disallowed residues 
for the model. Coordinates and structure factors are deposited in the 
RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB ID: 6U08).

Mutation frequency determination and SNP generation assay
To determine the frequency of mutations induced by expression of 
DddAtox and DddAtox(E1347A), overnight cultures of E. coli containing 
the expression plasmids for these proteins together with the plasmid 
for expression of DddIA were diluted 1:1,000 into fresh medium and 
grown until they reached the exponential phase (OD600 0.6). The cul-
tures were then induced with IPTG (80 μM) for DddIA and rhamnose 
(0.04% w/v) for DddAtox or DddAtox(E1347A) expression. The combined 
expression of both toxin and immunity proteins at this low level ena-
bles the cells expressing DddAtox to suffer growth arrest but does not 
result in a decrease in culture viability. After 1 h under these inducing 
conditions, cultures were supplemented with 1 mM of IPTG to increase 
DddIA expression and thus block DddA toxicity and were then grown 
for an additional 16 h. After this recovery period, the cultures were 
plated onto LBA containing rifampicin (100 μg ml−1) or no antibiotics. 
Mutation frequency was determined dividing the number of rifampicin 
resistant colonies by the total c.f.u obtained on non-selective medium.
For the genome-wide identification of SNPs that accumulate after low 
level expression of DddAtox or DddAtox(E1347A), E. coli Δudg strain car-
rying plasmids for expression of one of these proteins plus the plasmid 
for expressing DddIA was submitted to seven rounds of expression and 
recovery as described above, with cultures being plated after recovery 
and single colonies being selected and used to inoculate the subsequent 
round of expression. Randomly chosen single colonies were used to 
avoid introducing selection for increased fitness under the culture 
conditions46. Five isolated colonies from each starting population 
subjected to this regimen were selected for whole genome sequenc-
ing. We confirmed the presence of non-mutagenized DddAtox and 
DddAtox(E1347A) in these sequencing data.

Western blot for deaminase expression in E. coli
Western blotting to detect deaminases expressed in E. coli was per-
formed using rabbit anti-VSV-G (diluted 1:5,000, Sigma) and detected 
with anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary anti-
bodies (diluted 1:5,000, Sigma). Loading control was performed with 
mouse anti-RNAP (diluted 1:500, BioLegend) and detected with sheep 
anti-mouse (diluted 1:500, Millipore). Western blots were developed 
using chemiluminescent substrate (SuperSignal West Pico Substrate, 
Thermo Scientific) and imaged with a C600 imager (Azure Biosystems).

Western blot for deaminase expression in mammalian cells
HEK293T cells were transfected as described below. For preparation of 
cell lysate for western blot analysis of DdCBE, cells were lysed in 150 μl 
of ice-cold 1x RIPA buffer (Sigma) with added protease inhibitor (Roche 
Complete Mini) by incubating for 30 min at 4 °C with agitation. Lysates 
were cleared by pelleting at 12,000g for 10 min at 4 °C.
Next, 60 μl of cleared lysate supernatant was added to 20 μl of 4X 
LDS sample loading buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with a final DTT 
(Sigma Aldrich) concentration of 10 mM. Lysates were boiled for 10 
min at 95 °C. Then 15–20 μl of protein lysate was loaded into the wells 
of a Bolt 4–12% Bis-Tris Plus (Thermo Fisher Scientific) pre-cast gel. 6 μl  
of Precision Plus Protein Dual Colour Standard (Bio-Rad) was used as 
a reference. Samples were separated by electrophoresis at 180 V for  
45 min in Bolt MES SDS running buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Trans-
fer to a PVDF membrane was performed using an iBlot 2 Gel Transfer 
Device (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s 

protocols. The membrane was blocked in Odyssey Blocking Buffer 
(LI-COR) for 1 h at room temperature, then incubated with rat anti-Flag 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific MA1-142; 1:2,000 dilution), mouse anti-HA 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific 26183; 1:2,000 dilution) and rabbit anti-actin 
(CST 4970; 1:2,000 dilution) in blocking buffer (0.5% Tween-20 in 1x 
PBS, 0.2 μm filtered) overnight at 4 °C. The membrane was washed 
three times with TBST (1x TBS in 0.5% Tween-20, 0.2-μm filtered) for 
10 min each at room temperature, then incubated with IRDye-labelled 
secondary antibodies goat anti-rat 680RD (LI-COR 926-68076), goat 
anti-mouse 800CW (LI-COR 926-32210) and donkey anti-rabbit 800CW 
(LI-COR 926–32213) diluted 1:5,000 in blocking buffer for 1 h at room 
temperature. The membrane was washed as before, then imaged using 
an Odyssey Imaging System (LI-COR).

Mitochondria isolation and blue-native-PAGE analysis
Mitochondria isolation was performed as described47. Cells were col-
lected from the plates by pipetting in NKM buffer (1 mM Tris–HCl,  
pH 7.4, 130 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 7.5 mM MgCl2) followed by centrifu-
gation at 400g at 4 °C for 8 min. Pellets were resuspended in ice-cold 
0.1x homogenization buffer (4 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 2.5 mM NaCl, 
0.5 mM MgCl2) and incubated for 5 min on ice. Twenty strokes of a 
tight-fitting pestle (Dounce homogenizer) were applied to homog-
enize cells and buffer was adjusted to isotonic conditions by addition of 
one-ninth volume of 10x homogenization buffer. Cell debris and nuclei 
were pelleted by two succeeding centrifugations at 900g at 4 °C for  
4 min and mitochondria were collected by centrifugation at 10,000g at 
4 °C for 2 min. Then 50 μg of mitochondria were suspended in Native-
PAGE solubilization buffer (Thermo Fisher) with addition of digitonin 
at a ratio of 4 g digitonin per g protein and incubated on ice for 10 min. 
Samples were centrifuged 16,000g at 4 °C for 10 min, supernatants were 
collected to new tubes and NativePAGE G-250 Sample Additive (Thermo 
Fisher) was added to each sample to a final concentration of 0.25%. 
Samples were loaded onto NativePAGE 3–12% Bis-Tris Gels (Thermo 
Fisher) and electrophoresis was performed with the use of NativePAGE 
Running Buffer system (Thermo Fisher) at constant 150 V for 45 min 
at 4 °C followed by 250 V for 90 min at room temperature. After initial 
45 min electrophoresis, the Dark Blue Cathode Buffer was replaced 
with the Light Blue Cathode Buffer. After electrophoresis, transfer 
to a PVDF membrane (BioRad) was performed using semi-dry Trans 
Blot Turbo transfer system (BioRad). Membranes were incubated for 
5 min in 8% v/v acetic acid and washed briefly with methanol following 
5 min incubation in distilled H2O. Membranes were washed twice with 
TBST (TBS-Tween-20, Boston BioProducts) and blocked with 5% w/v 
Blotting-Grade Blocker (BioRad) in TBST. Membranes were incubated 
with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C (mouse anti-NDUFA9, Abcam 
14713, 1:1,000 dilution; rabbit anti-UQCRC2, Abcam 103616, 1:1,000 
dilution; mouse anti-ATP5A, Abcam 14748, 1:6,000 dilution; mouse 
anti-MTCO2, Abcam 110258, 1:1,000 dilution; mouse anti-SDHB, Abcam 
14714, 1:1,000 dilution). Membranes were washed 3 times for 10 min 
with TBST and incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 h at room tem-
perature followed by washing 3 times for 10 min with TBST. Membranes 
were incubated with Western Lightning Plus-ECL (PerkinElmer) and 
signal was registered on the Amersham Hyperfilm high performance 
autoradiography film (GE Healthcare). Films were scanned and 8-bit 
greyscale files were used for quantification with Fiji software48. For 
each image, a region of interest of the same size was used to quantify 
all bands and their corresponding background signals. Obtained values 
were inverted so that white pixels = 0 and black pixels = 255. Net values 
were calculated as a difference between band values and background 
values. Obtained net values were used to calculate the protein ratio of 
ND4-DdCBE-treated cells relative to mock-edited cells.

Purification of proteins for bacterial biochemical assays
Overnight cultures of E. coli BL21 pETDuet-1::dddAtox-dddIA, or E. coli 
BL21 pETDuet-1::dddAtox(E1347A) were used to inoculate 2 l of LB broth 

in a 1:100 dilution and cultures were grown to approximately OD600 0.6. 
At this point, plasmid expression was induced with 0.5 mM IPTG and 
the cultures were incubated for 16 h at 18 °C in a shaking incubator. Cell 
pellets were collected by centrifugation at 4,000g for 20 min, followed 
by resuspension in 50 ml of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 500 mM 
NaCl, 30 mM imidazole, 1 mM DTT, and 1 mg ml−1 lysozyme). Cell pellets 
were then lysed by sonication (5 pulses, 10 s each) and supernatant was 
separated by centrifugation at 25,000g for 30 min.
The DddAtox–DddIA complex or DddAtox(E1347A) was purified from cell 
lysates by nickel affinity chromatography using 4 ml of Ni-NTA agarose 
beads loaded onto a gravity-flow column. The supernatant was loaded 
onto the column and resin was washed with 50 ml of wash buffer (50 mM  
Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 30 mM imidazole, 1 mM DTT). Pro-
teins of interest were eluted with 5 ml elution buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl  
pH 7.5, 300 mM imidazole, 500 mM NaCl, 30 mM imidazole, 1 mM DTT). 
When DddAtox(E1347A) was purified, the eluted samples were applied 
directly to size-exclusion chromatography. For DddA–DddIA, the eluted 
samples underwent a denaturation and renaturation step to isolate only 
the toxin. In this case, the eluted proteins were added to 50 ml 8 M urea 
denaturing buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 300 mM imidazole, 500 mM 
NaCl and 1 mM DTT) and incubated for 16 h at 4 °C. The 8 M urea denatur-
ing buffer with the eluted proteins was loaded on a gravity-flow column 
with 4 ml Ni-NTA agarose beads. The column was washed with 50 ml 8 M 
urea denaturing buffer to remove any remaining DddIA. While still bound 
to Ni-NTA agarose beads, DddAtox was renatured by sequential washes 
with 25 ml denaturing buffer with decreasing concentrations of urea  
(6 M, 4 M, 2 M, 1 M), and a last wash with wash buffer to remove remaining 
traces of urea. Proteins bound to the column were then eluted with 5 ml 
elution buffer. The eluted samples were purified again by size-exclusion 
chromatography using fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) with 
gel filtration on a Superdex200 column (GE Healthcare) in sizing buffer 
(20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 5% (w/v) glycerol). The 
fraction purity was evaluated by SDS–PAGE gel stained with Coomassie 
blue and the highest quality factions were stored at −80 °C.

DNA deamination assays
All the DNA substrates were purchased from IDT, and a 6-FAM fluoro-
phore was added for visualization (see Supplementary Table 12 for 
substrate sequences). Reactions were performed in 10 μl of deamina-
tion buffer (20 mM MES pH 6.4, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 8% Ficoll 70 
and 1 μM substrate) with APOBEC3A, DddAtox or DddAtox(E1347A) at the 
concentrations indicated in Fig. 1f, g and Extended Data Fig. 1d. Reac-
tions were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, followed by the addition of 5 μl of 
UDG solution (New England Biolabs, 0.02 U μl−1 UDG in 1X UDG buffer) 
and further incubated for 30 min. Cleavage of substrates was induced 
by addition of 100 mM NaOH and incubation at 95 °C for 3 min. Samples 
were analysed by denaturing 15% acrylamide gel electrophoresis and 
the resulting fluorescent DNA fragments were detected by fluorescence 
imaging with Azure Biosystems.

Poisoned primer extension assay for RNA deamination
All substrate sequences are listed in Supplementary Table 12. The RNA 
substrates and the oligonucleotide containing a 5′ 6-FAM fluorophore 
for visualization were purchased from IDT. Deamination reactions were 
performed in 10 μl of RNA deamination buffer (Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 200 mM 
NaCl, 1 mM DTT) with the addition of 1 μM of DddAtox or DddAtox(E1347A). 
Substrate combinations and concentrations were added as indicated in 
Extended Data Fig. 1e, f, and reactions were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. 
cDNA synthesis was performed in a 10-μl reaction (2.5 U μl−1 MultiScribe 
Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Fisher), 1 μl deamination reaction,  
1.5 μM oligonucleotide, 100 μM dATP, 100 μM dCTP, 100 μM dTTP, and 
100 μM ddGTP). The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min and 
samples were analysed by denaturing 15% acrylamide gel electropho-
resis. The synthesized cDNA fragments were detected by fluorescence 
imaging with a C600 (Azure Biosystems).

Genome sequencing and SNP identification in bacteria
Overnight cultures from isolated colonies were used for total gDNA 
extraction with the DNeasy Blood & Tissue kit (Qiagen), and extraction 
yield was quantified using a Qubit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Sequenc-
ing libraries were constructed using the Nextera DNA Flex Library Prep 
Kit (Illumina). Library quality and concentration was evaluated with a 
Qubit and TapeStation System (Agilent). Sequencing was performed 
with an Illumina MiSeq instrument (300 cycles paired end program). 
Genome mapping was performed with BWA49 using the E. coli MG1655 
(NC_000913.3) genome as a reference. Pileup data from alignments 
were generated with SAMtools and variant calling was performed with 
VarScan250. SNPs were considered valid if they were present at a fre-
quency greater than 90%.

Mammalian cell culture
All cells were cultured and maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Anti-
biotics were not used for cell culture of HEK293T cells, U2OS cells, 
T-Rex-293-based POLGdn cells and primary fibroblasts. HEK293T cells 
(CRL-3216, American Type Culture Collection (ATCC)) were cultured in 
DMEM with GlutaMax (Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 
10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Gibco). U2OS cells (HTB-96, ATCC) were 
cultured in McCoy’s 5A medium with GlutaMax (Thermo Fisher Scien-
tific) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Gibco). HeLa 
cells (ATCC CCL-2) were cultured in high glucose DMEM (Gibco) with 
10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biological), and 100 U ml−1 penicillin 
(Sigma-Aldrich). Primary human fibroblasts (GM04541, Coriell) were 
cultured in DMEM with GlutaMAX supplemented with 20% (v/v) FBS 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific). T-Rex-293-based POLGdn cells31 were cul-
tured in DMEM with GlutaMax (Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented 
with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Gibco), 1 mM sodium pyruvate and  
50 μg ml−1 uridine (Sigma-Aldrich). Cell lines were authenticated by 
their respective suppliers and tested negative for mycoplasma.

HEK293T and T-Rex-293-based POLGdn mammalian cell 
lipofection
Cells were seeded on 48-well collagen-coated plates (Corning) at a den-
sity of 2 × 105 cells per ml (250 μl total per well), 18–24 h before lipofec-
tion. Lipofection was performed at a cell density of approximately 70%. 
For split DddAtox–Cas9 screening, cells were transfected with 375 ng  
of split DddAtox–dSpCas9 monomer expression plasmid, 375 ng of split 
DddAtox–SaKKH-Cas9(D10A) monomer expression plasmid, 125 ng of 
SpCas9 guide RNA (gRNA) expression plasmid and 125 ng of SaKKH 
gRNA plasmid. pUC19 was used as a filler DNA for monomer and 
no-gRNA control experiments to make up to 1,000 ng of total plasmid 
DNA. For DdCBE experiments, cells were transfected with 500 ng of 
each mitoTALE monomer to make up 1,000 ng of total plasmid DNA. 
Lipofectamine 2000 (1.5 μl, Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used per 
well. Cells were collected at the indicated time point.
For western blot analysis of DdCBEs expressed in mammalian cells, 
HEK293T cells were seeded on 6-well tissue culture-treated plates 
(Corning) at a density of 2 × 105 cells per ml (2 ml total per well), 18–24 h  
before lipofection. Cells were transfected with 4,000 ng of each 
mitoTALE monomer to make up 8,000 ng of total plasmid DNA. Lipo-
fectamine 2000 (12 μl; ThermoFisher Scientific) was used per well. 
Cells were collected at the indicated time point.

U2OS cell plasmid nucleofection
We combined 500 ng of Left DdCBE monomer and 500 ng of Right 
DdCBE monomer in a volume that did not exceed 2 μl. This combined 
plasmid mixture was nucleofected in a final volume of 22 μl per sample 
in a 16-well Nucleocuvette strip (Lonza). U2OS cells were nucleofected 
using the SE Cell Line 4D-Nucleofector X Kit (Lonza) with 30,000–
50,000 cells per sample (program DN-100), according to the manu-
facturer’s protocol.

Cas9 mRNA in vitro transcription
A DNA fragment containing a T7 promoter driving expression of 
polyadenylated Cas9 transcript was isolated from purified plasmid 
(5 μg) using SpeI-HF restriction digestion (New England Biolabs) and 
purified with the MinElute PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen). mRNA was 
transcribed using the HiScribe T7 ARCA mRNA Kit (NEB) and purified 
using MEGAclear Transcription Clean-up kit (Thermo Fisher) according 
to the manufacturer’s instructions and stored at −80 °C.

Human primary fibroblast nucleofection
Human primary fibroblasts were nucleofected as previously described51. 
In brief, 500 ng of in vitro-transcribed Left-DdCBE mRNA and 500 ng of 
in vitro-transcribed Right-DdCBE mRNA were combined in a volume 
that did not exceed 2 μl. This combined mRNA mixture was nucleo-
fected in a final volume of 22 μl per sample in a 16-well Nucleocuvette 
strip (Lonza). Human primary fibroblasts (GM04541, Coriell) were 
nucleofected using the P2 Primary Cell 4D-Nucleofector kit (Lonza) 
with 2.5 × 105 cells per sample (program DS-150), according to the manu-
facturer’s protocol. The medium was changed after 24 h of nucleofec-
tion and cultured for 5 days before collection for high-throughput 
sequencing.

Cell viability assays
Cell viability was measured every 3 to 6 days over an 18-day time 
course using the CellTiter-Glo 2.0 assay (Promega) according to the 
manufacturer’s protocol. Luminescence was measured in 96-well flat 
black-bottomed polystyrene microplates (Corning) using a M1000 Pro 
microplate reader (Tecan) with a 1-s integration time.

Genomic DNA isolation from mammalian cell culture
Medium was removed, and cells were washed once with 1× Dulbecco’s 
phosphate-buffered saline (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Genomic DNA 
extraction was performed by addition of 40 μl freshly prepared lysis 
buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.05% SDS, and proteinase K (20 μg ml−1;  
Thermo Fisher Scientific)) directly into the 48-well culture well. The 
extraction solution was incubated at 37 °C for 60 min and then 80 °C for 
20 min. The resulting genomic DNA was subjected to bead cleanup with 
AMPure DNAdvance beads according to the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions (Beckman Coulter A48705).
For DNA isolation and Sanger sequencing of ND4-edited cells, total 
DNA was extracted from cells with the use of DNeasy Blood & Tissue 
Kit (Qiagen). The ND4 gene fragment spanning the edited m.11922 site 
was amplified with the use of AccuPrime Taq DNA Polymerase System 
(Thermo Fisher). Primers used for the PCR are listed in Supplementary 
Table 13. PCR reaction products were purified by gel extraction with the 
use of QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen) and subjected to Sanger 
sequencing at Genwiz.

High-throughput DNA sequencing of genomic DNA samples
Genomic sites of interest were amplified from genomic DNA samples 
and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq as previously described with the 
following modifications52. Amplification primers containing Illumina 
forward and reverse adapters (Supplementary Table 13) were used for 
a first round of PCR (PCR 1) to amplify the genomic region of interest. 
In brief, 1 μl of purified genomic DNA was used as input into the first 
round of PCR (PCR1). For PCR1, DNA was amplified to the top of the 
linear range using Phusion Hot Start II High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific), according to the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions but with the addition of 0.5x SYBR Green Nucleic Acid Gel Stain 
(Lonza) in each 25-μl reaction. For all amplicons, the PCR1 protocol 
used was an initial heating step of 2 min at 98 °C followed by an opti-
mized number of amplification cycles (10 s at 98 °C, 20 s at 62 °C, 30 s 
at 72 °C). Quantitative PCR was performed to determine the optimal 
cycle number for each amplicon. The number of cycles needed to reach 

the top of the linear range of amplification are about 27–28 cycles for 
nuclear DNA amplicons and about 17–19 cycles for mtDNA amplicons. 
Barcoding PCR2 reactions (25 μl) were performed with 1 μl of unpuri-
fied PCR1 product and amplified with Q5 Hot Start MasterMix (NEB) 
using the following protocol: 98 °C for 2 min, then 9 cycles of (98 °C for  
10 s, 61 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 30 s), followed by a final 72 °C extension 
for 2 min. PCR products were evaluated analytically by electrophore-
sis in a 1.5% agarose gel. After PCR2, up to 300 samples with different 
barcode combinations were combined and purified by gel extraction 
using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen). DNA concentration 
was quantified using the Qubit ssDNA HS Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher 
Scientific) to make up a 4 nM library. The library concentration was 
further verified by qPCR (KAPA Library Quantification Kit-Illumina, 
Kapa Biosystems) and sequenced using an Illumina MiSeq with 210- to 
300-bp single-end reads.

Analysis of high-throughput sequencing data for DNA 
sequencing and targeted amplicon sequencing
Sequencing reads were demultiplexed using MiSeq Reporter (Illumina). 
Batch analysis with CRISPResso253 was used for targeted amplicon and 
DNA sequencing analysis. A 10-bp window was used to quantify indels 
centred around the middle of the dsDNA spacing. To set the cleavage 
offset, a hypothetical 15-or 16-bp spacing region has a cleavage offset 
of −8. Otherwise, the default parameters were used for analysis. The 
output file “Reference.NUCLEOTIDE_PERCENTAGE_SUMMARY.txt” was 
imported into Microsoft Excel for quantification of editing frequen-
cies. Reads containing indels within the 10-bp window are excluded for 
calculation of editing frequencies. The output file “CRISPRessoBatch_
quantification_of_editing_frequency.txt” was imported into Microsoft 
Excel for quantification of indel frequencies. Indel frequencies were 
computed by dividing the sum of insertions and deletions over the 
total number of aligned reads.

Determination of relative total mitochondrial DNA levels by 
quantitative PCR
Quantitative PCR (qPCR) reactions were performed on a Bio-Rad 
CFX96/C1000 qPCR machine performed using SYBR green (Lonza). 
For Extended Data Fig. 6i, 5 ng of purified DNA was used as template 
input in a 25-μl reaction volume. For Extended Data Fig. 8a, 8 ng of 
purified DNA was used as template input in a 25-μl reaction volume. 
For all reactions, the protocol used was an initial heating step of 
2 min at 98 °C followed by 40 cycles of amplification (10 s at 98 °C, 
20 s at 62 °C, 15 s at 72 °C). Single threshold values (∆C) were deter-
mined by manufacturer’s software. For Extended Data Fig. 6i, the 
level of mtDNA was determined by the calculating the ratio of total 
mtDNA to genomic DNA (β-actin) (Ratio = EmtDNA
Eβ-actin ∆C(DdCBE – dead DdCBE), where E is the efficiency of the qPCR reaction; 
END6 = 0.858, END5 = 0.844, EATP8 = 0.995, Eβ-actin = 1.05). For the assessment 
of mtDNA level in Extended Data Fig. 8a, 8 ng of isolated DNA was used 
in qPCR reaction performed with the use of iQ SYBR Green Supermix 
(Bio-Rad). Relative abundance of the amplified ND1 gene fragment  
was normalized to the amplified B2M gene fragment. See Supplemen-
tary Table 13 for list of primers used. NC_012920 was used as the ref-
erence for mtDNA; NG_003019 was used as the reference for human 
ACTBP2.

∆C(DdCBE – dead DdCBE)/ 

RNA isolation and RT-qPCR
Total RNA was extracted from cells with the use of RNeasy Mini Kit 
(Qiagen) and digested with DNase I (Qiagen). Isolated RNA (500 ng) was 
used for reverse transcription performed with the use of SuperScript 
III First-Strand Synthesis SuperMix for qRT–PCR (Thermo Fisher). The 
obtained cDNA was used for qPCR. Analysis of mitochondrial gene 
expression was performed with the use of iQ SYBR Green Supermix 
(BioRad) using primers listed in Supplementary Table 13. Data was 
normalized to B2M abundance.

Oxygen consumption analysis by Seahorse XF analyser
Seahorse plate was coated with 0.01% (w/v) poly-l-lysine (Sigma). Cells 
(1.6 × 104) were seeded on the coated Seahorse plate 16 h before the anal-
ysis in the Seahorse XFe96 Analyzer (Agilent). Analysis was performed 
in the Seahorse XF DMEM Medium pH 7.4 (Agilent) supplemented with 
10 mM glucose (Agilent), 2 mM l-glutamine (Gibco) and 1 mM sodium 
pyruvate (Gibco). Mito stress protocol was applied with the use of  
1.5 mM oligomycin, 1 mM FCCP and 1 mM piericidin + 1 mM antimycin.

Complex I and IV activity assay
Complex I activity assay was performed with the use of colorimetric 
Complex I Enzyme Activity Microplate Assay Kit (Abcam) according to 
the manufacturer’s protocol. Complex IV activity assay was performed 
with the use of colorimetric Complex IV Human Enzyme Activity Micro-
plate Assay Kit (Abcam) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. In 
brief, cells were collected and washed twice with PBS (Gibco) followed 
by protein extraction and incubation of clarified cell lysates at concen-
tration of 0.25 mg ml−1 on the microplates for 3 h at room temperature. 
Complex I activity was determined by measurement of absorbance at 
OD = 450 nm, which is increased by reduction of a dye simultaneous 
to NADH to NAD+ oxidation. Complex IV activity was determined by 
measurement of absorbance at OD = 550 nm, which decreases follow-
ing oxidation of reduced cytochrome c.

Long-range PCR to detect mtDNA deletions
Long-range PCR was performed on purified genomic DNA as previously 
with listed primers (Supplementary Table 13) to capture the whole 
mtDNA genome as two overlapping fragment of around 8 kb each. In 
brief, around 50–200 ng of purified DNA was used as input for amplifi-
cation by PRIMESTAR GXL DNA polymerase (Takara). For all reactions, 
the protocol used was an initial heating step of 1 min at 94 °C followed 
by 30 cycles of amplification (30 s at 98 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, 9 min at 72 °C). 
Unpurified PCR products were run on 0.8% agarose gel and stained 
with ethidium bromide.

Immunocytochemical studies of DdCBE localization
HeLa cells were transfected with a total of 1 ug of plasmid DNA (500 ng 
for each monomer) to express left (HA-tagged) or right (Flag-tagged) 
monomers of each DdCBE using Lipofectamine 3000 (Thermo Fisher) 
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. After 24 h incubation, cells 
were labelled with MitoTracker Deep Red (Thermo Fisher) at a final 
concentration of 100 nM for 30 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator. Cells 
were then seeded on an 8-well chamber glass slide (Ibidi) and fixed in 
4% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 15 min at room temperature. Next, cells 
were washed twice with PBS and permeabilized in PBS containing 0.1% 
saponin and 1% BSA for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were then 
immunostained with anti-HA (Biolegend) or anti-Flag (Sigma Aldrich), 
followed by Alexa-Fluor conjugated anti-mouse (HA tag) or anti-rabbit 
(Flag tag) secondary antibodies (Thermo Fisher). Images were taken 
using a 60× objective with the high-resolution widefield Nikon system. 
Acquired images were processed in Fiji48.

Bulk ATAC–seq for whole mitochondrial genome sequencing
Assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing (ATAC–
seq) was performed as previously described54. In brief, 5,000–10,000 
cells were trypsinzed, washed with cold 1X PBS, pelleted by centrifuga-
tion (500g at 4 °C for 5 min) and lysed in 50 μl of cold and freshly pre-
pared lysis buffer (0.1% Igepal CA-360 (v/v %), 10 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM 
NaCl and 3 mM MgCl2 in nuclease-free water). Lysates were incubated 
on ice for 3 min, pelleted at 500g for 10 min at 4 °C and tagmented with 
2.5 μl of Tn5 transposase (Illumina, 15027865) in a total volume of 10 μl 
containing 1x TD buffer (Illumina, 15027866),0.1% NP-40 (Sigma) and 
0.3x PBS. Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min on a thermomixer 
at 300 rpm. DNA was purified using the MinElute PCR Kit (Qiagen) 

and eluted in 10 μl elution buffer. All 10 μl of the eluate was amplified 
using indexed primers (1.25 μM each) listed in Supplementary Table 13 
and NEBNext High-Fidelity 2X PCR Master Mix (NEB) in a total volume 
of 50 μl using the following protocol: 72 °C for 5 min, 98 °C for 30 s, 
then 5 cycles of (98 °C for 10 s, 63 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 60 s), fol-
lowed by a final 72 °C extension for 1 min. After the initial 5 cycles of 
pre-amplification, 5 μl of partially amplified library was used as input 
DNA in a total volume of 15 μl for quantitative PCR using SYBR Green 
(0.5x, Lonza) to determine the number of additional cycles needed to 
reach 1/3 of the maximum fluorescence intensity. Typically, 3–8 cycles 
were conducted on the remaining 45 μl of partially amplified library. 
The final library was purified using a MinElute PCR kit (Qiagen) and 
quantified using a Qubit dsDNA HS Assay kit (Invitrogen) and a High 
Sensitivity DNA chip run on a Bioanalyzer 2100 system (Agilent). All 
libraries were sequenced using Nextseq High Output Cartridge kits on 
an Illumina Nextseq 500 sequencer. Libraries were sequenced using 
paired-end 2×75 cycles and demultiplexed using the bcl2fastq program.

Targeted amplicon sequencing for nuclear DNA off-target 
analyses
Genomic DNA was isolated and purified as described in the section 
“Genomic DNA isolation from mammalian cell culture”. The on-target 
mtDNA binding sites for ND6-, ND5.1- and ND4-DdCBE were aligned to 
the NCBI reference sequence for human chromosome 5 (NC_000005.10) 
to identify MTND6P4, MTND5P11 and MTND4P12. These pseudogenes 
are regions in the nuclear DNA that contain the greatest homology to 
their respective DdCBE binding sites in mtDNA. Samples were pre-
pared for high-throughput sequencing as described in the section 
“High-throughput DNA sequencing of genomic DNA samples”. The 
following primers were used for appending sequencing adapters to 
MTND6P4: MTND6P4 forward: ACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCC 
GATCTNNNNGTTGTAGCCCGTGCAAGAATAATG; MTND6P4 reverse: 
TGGAGTTCAGACGTGTGCTCTTCCGATCTTAACACTAATCCTACTTCC 
ATC. For MTND5P11 and MTND4P12, a 5 kb region was amplified with 
primer set 1 (Forward 1 and Forward 2) to ensure selective ampli-
fication of nuclear DNA rather than mtDNA. The 5-kb fragment was 
purified using MinElute PCR Kit (Qiagen) and used as the DNA input 
for subsequent amplification steps using the indicated sequencing 
adaptor primers: Forward 1: CTAATTCTCTTTGAGGAGCATGGTTAG; 
Forward 2: TATCACTTCCAGCCACCTATTTCC; MTND5P11 forward:

Genome sequencing and SNP identification in mitochondria
SNP identification in mitochondria was performed similarly to in bac-
teria, with the following modifications. Genome mapping was per-
formed with BWA (v.0.7.17) using NC_012920 genome as a reference. 
Duplicates were marked using Picard tools (v.2.20.7). Pileup data from 
alignments were generated with SAMtools (v.1.9) and variant calling 
was performed with VarScan2 (v.2.4.3). Variants that were present at a 
frequency greater than 0.1% and a P value less than 0.05 (Fisher’s exact 
test) were called as high-confidence SNPs independently in each bio-
logical replicate. Only reads with a Phred quality score (Q) of greater 
than 30 at a given position were taken into account when calling SNPs 
at that particular position.

Calculation of average off-target C•G-to-T•A editing frequency
To calculate the mitochondrial genome-wide average off-target edit-
ing frequency for each DdCBE in Fig. 5b, we used REDItools (v.1.2.1)55. 
All nucleobases except cytosines and guanines were removed and the 
number of reads covering each C•G base pair with a Phred quality score 

greater than 30 (Q > 30) was calculated. The on-target C•G base pairs 
(depending on the DdCBE used in each treatment) were excluded in 
order to consider only off-target effects. C•G-to-T•A SNVs present at 
high frequencies (greater than 50%) in both treated and untreated 
samples (that therefore did not arise from DdCBE treatment) were also 
excluded. The average off-target editing frequency was then calculated 
independently for each biological replicate of each treatment condition 
as: (number of reads in which a given C•G base pair was called as a T•A 
base pair, summed over all non-target C•G base pairs)/(total number 
of reads that covered all non-target C•G base pair). Sequence logos 
in Fig. 5c, depicting the local sequence context of all off-target SNVs, 
were generated as described previously56. For Supplementary Tables 8 
and 9, the average frequency of each SNV was calculated by taking the 
average of three frequencies from the biological triplicates.

Effect prediction of the C•G-to-T•A off-target SNVs identified by 
ATAC–seq
SIFT57 (https://sift.bii.a-star.edu.sg /) was used to predict the out-
come of nonsynonymous mutations on protein function. High- and 
low-confidence calls were made using standard SIFT parameters with 
GRCh37.74 database as the reference genome.

For all statistical analyses, confirm that the following items are present in the figure legend, table legend, main text, or Methods section.

n/a Confirmed

The exact sample size (n) for each experimental group/condition, given as a discrete number and unit of measurement

A statement on whether measurements were taken from distinct samples or whether the same sample was measured repeatedly
The statistical test(s) used AND whether they are one- or two-sided 

Only common tests should be described solely by name; describe more complex techniques in the Methods section.

A description of all covariates tested

A description of any assumptions or corrections, such as tests of normality and adjustment for multiple comparisons

A full description of the statistical parameters including central tendency (e.g. means) or other basic estimates (e.g. regression coefficient) 
AND variation (e.g. standard deviation) or associated estimates of uncertainty (e.g. confidence intervals)

For null hypothesis testing, the test statistic (e.g. F, t, r) with confidence intervals, effect sizes, degrees of freedom and P value noted 

Give P values as exact values whenever suitable.

For Bayesian analysis, information on the choice of priors and Markov chain Monte Carlo settings

For hierarchical and complex designs, identification of the appropriate level for tests and full reporting of outcomes

Estimates of effect sizes (e.g. Cohen's d, Pearson's r), indicating how they were calculated

Our web collection on statistics for biologists contains articles on many of the points above.

Software and code

Policy information about availability of computer code
Data collection

High-throughput sequencing data was collected on Illumina Miseq and Nextseq instruments. 

Data analysis

High-throughput sequencing data was analyzed using CRISPResso2 Sequencing reads were demultiplexed using the MiSeq Reporter 
(Illumina) and fastq files were analyzed using Crispresso2. Prism 8 (GraphPad) was used to generate dot plots and bar plots of these data.  
For mitochondrial genome analysis, Genome mapping was performed with BWA (v0.7.17) using NC_012920 genome as a reference. 
Duplicates were marked using Picard tools (v2.20.7). Pileup data from alignments were generated with SAMtools (v1.9) and variant 
calling was performed with VarScan2 (v2.4.3). Variants that were present at a frequency greater than 0.1% and a p-value less than 0.05 
(Fisher’s Exact Test) were called as high-confidence SNPs independently in each biological replicate. Only reads with Q > 30 at a given 
position were taken into account when calling SNPs at that particular position. Further details and references and provided in the 
Methods. For the generation of sequence logos, flanking sequences were aligned, fixing the mutant cytosine in each case at position 21, 
and the resulting alignment was used to produce a sequence logo using WebLogo 3.6.0. Further details and references are provided in 
the Methods.

For manuscripts utilizing custom algorithms or software that are central to the research but not yet described in published literature, software must be made available to editors/reviewers. 
We strongly encourage code deposition in a community repository (e.g. GitHub). See the Nature Research guidelines for submitting code & software for further information.
